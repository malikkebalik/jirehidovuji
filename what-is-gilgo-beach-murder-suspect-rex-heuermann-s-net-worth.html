Recommended Videos It took almost ten years for investigators to find enough evidence to tie Heuerman back to the crimes, but with substantial DNA evidence, witness testimony, and some pretty damning Google searches made over the years, the victims’ families are hopeful that this menace will end up behind bars."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The New York native <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">owned a Midtown Manhattan-based</a> consultancy practice, Rex Heuermann Consultants and Associates off <a href=#>5th Avenue</a> (the rent alone was a whopping $150K a month, for some perspective) and had worked in Manhattan for at least 3 decades.</p><p data-characters=686 data-current-count=1058 data-injectable=true>His job as an architect varied between the everyday (like recommending that a leaky building undergo waterproofing), to working with the state’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Buildings</a>, which deals in construction safety, development, and even code inspection. In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2007, Heuermann was investigated</a> for potentially providing false information. He claimed a crumbling apartment building was vacant, despite the more than 26 families residing there. It wasn’t until the NYFD got involved that the families were helped, but Heuermann never offered any comments over the mix-up. Further review led investigators to believe it was an isolated incident, rather than a pattern of disrespect for human life.</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>Heuermann has been locked in more than one lawsuit since 2014. Over the last decade, he has opened four civil cases against other drivers, alleging “setious and permanent personal injuries” from road incidents. Three of the four cases have been settled or dismissed (the payouts are unknown), and one is still underway.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true>The hulking sexagenarian was living in his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">modest childhood home</a> – which sits just a few miles away from where his victim’s bodies were found – with his wife, her son, and Heuermann’s daughter. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Massapequa Park</a> area boasts houses priced between $400K and $2 million, and the neighboring homes on 1st Avenue fall closer to the $1 million mark. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>Despite his high earnings, prime real estate location, and sue-happy tendencies, Heuermann was several thousand dollars behind in his tax payments (just like the rich, isn’t it?). Tax liens filed by the IRS show that Heuermann owed more than $425k in 2020, of which he has paid just over $215K. As a couple, he and his wife, Asa Ellerup, owe $81.5K to the IRS.</p><p data-characters=81 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>Despite these crazy-high debts, Heuermann is still worth an estimated $7 million.</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true>The family he’s leaving behind includes his now ex-wife, Asa Ellerup, who filed for divorce just 6 days after her husband was charged. After months of silence, she’s<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> selling her story as a documentary </a>for a whopping $1 million dollars. Though no charges have been formally brought against her, new evidence suggests that Heuermann had a female accomplice. Ellerup’s lawyer denies his client was involved. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=false>Since Heuerman was arrested, Ellerup has relied on bystander sympathy. Despite the reported millions in the bank, Ellerup <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has a GoFundMe</a>, which claims that the now single mother of two adult children is working to gain her financial independence. With more than $50K in the bank and another million on the way, it might seem like Ellerup’s well prepared for the future, but her lawyer alone is set to make a six-figure payout for his part. &nbsp;The New York Post reports that by the end, he’ll have netted something near the $400,000 mark.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6y1osCMoqpmn5mhtLB5wZ6YnKBdosKzsMSrZKyto6WypMCMq5yxZZiawqa%2BzJqlp6tdo7K1edaoqa2gXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
