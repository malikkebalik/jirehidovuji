Berlin's Chief Of Station Has Her Sights Set On Carrie</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-07-05</div><p>It's that time of year again: After a pretty darn stellar Season 4, finally (finally!) <a href=# class=T3D><i>Homeland</i> is returning for Season 5</a>. The new season has a lot going for it — like last year's Islamabad-set story, it looks like the team is shaking things up again, both geography-wise, cast-wise, and even time-wise. Season 5 will jump ahead two years, be set almost exclusively in Berlin (which, according to the <i>New York Times</i>, gives the show <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>a new Cold War-esque rhythm</a>), and it will feature — count 'em — <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>four new series regulars</a>. Among said new characters? Australian actor <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Miranda Otto, who will play Allison Carr</a>, aka Berlin's Chief of Station, as reported by Deadline.</p><p>Otto joins the cast along with <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Sarah Sokolovic, Sebastian Koch, and Alexander Fehling</a>, and her character Allison will factor pretty heavily into the new season. She'll be working closely with fan favorite (and ultra-deft death-dodger) Saul Berenson, as they try to uncover the latest espionage plot mounting against them, in which one Carrie Mathison (now a civilian working in private security) is a prime suspect. Yep, after what Richard Lawson of <i>Vanity Fair</i> refers to as "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>an Edward Snowden-esque data leak</a>," Carrie's relationship with a reporter linked to the leak leads her former CIA bosses to think she's the mastermind behind the disaster — so Saul and Allison quickly go on the defensive.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Oh, and as if that wasn't already enough of <i>Homeland's</i> signature brand of drama, the (<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>largely positive</a>) <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>advance reviews of the first couple episodes</a> also imply that Allison and Saul's relationship may even be of the romantic variety — so keep your seat belts firmly buckled for that possibility.</p><p>For her part, Otto (whom you may recognize as <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Eowyn from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy</a>), seems <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>excited to be joining the popular Showtime drama</a> and her intriguing character sounds like she'll make a nice addition to our team of old <i>Homeland</i> stalwarts. As she said to Sydney's <i>Daily Telegraph,</i></p>It’s a great role. I got very lucky on this one ... She’s very much on the front foot and she’s ballsy, definitely. She is very in control and very, sure of what she’s doing.<p>Excited yet? There are a lot of reasons to look forward to the new season (after all, Season 4 effectively left us dangling off of several cliffs) and now we can add Berlin CIA Station Chief Allison Carr to the list.</p><p><i>Images: Stephan Rabold/Showtime (2)</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyfZNva29lp528brXSZpilpJmovK95wpqpq2Wfo3qpu8yeo5qmlGKvpr7LoqWsZZOdtqayjKidZquklsGqu81mn5qrXZ2ys3nSop6hrKNiwKbAjKilZpuRp7%2BqsQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
