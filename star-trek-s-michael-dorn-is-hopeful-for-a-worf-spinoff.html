Fans&nbsp;will probably know that actor Michael Dorn has been trying to get a spinoff show for his character Worf, the Klingon Starfleet officer, off the ground for a while, and now that CBS is looking to the past again for new material, Dorn’s dusting off his idea.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>While attending Destination Star Trek in Birmingham, UK, this weekend, Dorn told the crowd at a Q&A that he’s encouraged by the development of the Picard show to start thinking about what it might mean for the future of Worf in the franchise. This echoes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statements the actor’s made before</a>, in which he said the new series could really open doors for him.</p><p>“I think this Worf thing would be perfect — I mean, really perfect. It’s just a matter of getting the phone number of the right guy or getting the email of the right person that can actually get you in there. It’s a little early in the game right now, but I still think there’s hope for it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Dn3mk9JXUAI2dwP.jpg><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=true>Dorn’s pitch is for a show titled either&nbsp;The Worf Chronicles&nbsp;or&nbsp;Captain Worf, which would see the character leave Starfleet to serve in the Klingon empire. As such, it would explore Klingon society and culture to a greater extent than previous series have managed to achieve. Given the race’s continued popularity, you can be sure that this is something the fans would definitely want to see.</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Obviously, the easiest way to bring Worf back would be for him to cameo on Picard’s new show. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the&nbsp;TNG&nbsp;cast has revealed</a> that none of them besides Sir Patrick have been contacted about the production. There’s always hope though that like&nbsp;Discovery, it could open itself up to more links to <strong>Star Trek</strong>‘s&nbsp;past <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in future seasons</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0wMCrZK2qlaDAbrnInJ%2BanZxisbC%2BzWafqKiVm8KtedaoqZ9lo6W2r7vFn2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
