The path to Terminus was marked until Rick edited it to be a warning, and Morgan appeared to be following a series of markings in trees. In Sunday night's episode, the group came across a walker with a "W" on his forehead. <a href=# class=T3D>What does "W" mean on </a><i><a href=# class=T3D>The Walking Dead</a>? </i>Who would go through all the trouble to mark a zombie's head... and then not kill that zombie? Something fishy is going on here.</p><p>Is this in any way related to the red "A" that Jessie's son stamped onto Rick's hand at Deanna's party? Presumably, that stands for Alexandria. However, comparisons to <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> (or at least <i>Easy A) </i>are unavoidable. But for now, let's focus on what that W could stand for.</p><h3>Walkers</h3><p>That's the most obvious one, right? It may seem a little redundant to mark a Walker with a W. Perhaps this was part of a ritual. Perhaps, in the early days of the epidemic before it became clear that everyone was infected and would become a zombie upon death, the bitten dead or dying were marked. On the other hand, is "walker" a universal term for these creatures? It seems like different groups have different names for them.</p><h3>Wolves</h3><p>There's a theory roaming around that the next group to show up on <i>The Walking Dead</i> <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>is called the Wolves</a>, and that could be who is marking these zombies. Are the Wolves a rival gang of survivors, like the Scavengers or <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Negan and the Saviors</a>? Or are they, as the folks at Uproxx put together, <a href=# class=T3D>Rick Grimes' own team</a>? In that case, are the markings a type of warning to them? Spooky.</p><h3>The Hobo Code</h3><p>I've wondered before if <a href=# class=T3D><i>The Walking Dead</i> was using the Hobo Code</a>, an old practice of carving symbols into trees and whatever was around to inform fellow travelers about different threats. There is a symbol in the hobo code that looks a little bit like this marking, and it means "barking dog." There doesn't seem to be a connection there, but you never know.</p><p><i>Image: Gene Page/AMC</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHx3hJRxamavmJbBbrDOnqpmr12isqK6jKilZqyYmnq4rcukoKefXZmyorCMrZ%2Beq5Viu6bDjKaYq6OZo7S0ecCrnGarpai9qq%2FOrqo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
