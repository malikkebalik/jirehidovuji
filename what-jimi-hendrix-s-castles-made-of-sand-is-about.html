One of these was “Castles Made of Sand,” taken from the band’s 1967 second album, Axis: Bold as Love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-jimi-hendrix-released-castles-made-of-sand-in-1967>Jimi Hendrix released ‘Castles Made of Sand’ in 1967</h2><p id=par-2_93>Jimi Hendrix first broke in to the music industry in the early 1960s as a backup guitarist for major artists at the time including Little Richard, Ike and Tina Turner, and The Isley Brothers. In the mid-1960s, he took his talents center stage and created his own band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience. He was joined by bassist/backing vocalist/songwriter&nbsp;Noel Redding and drummer/backing vocalist&nbsp;Mitch Mitchell.&nbsp;The group released their debut album, Are You Experienced, in May 1967 — a project that is highly regarded as one of the greatest rock albums of all time today.</p><p id=par-3_43>The Jimi Hendrix Experience quickly followed up Are You Experienced with their sophomore album, Axis: Bold as Love, released in December of that year. “Castles Made of Sand” wasn’t released as a single, but remained a memorable track from the LP regardless.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>The meaning behind Jimi Hendrix’s ‘Castles Made of Sand’</h2><p id=par-4_120>With lyrics like “Down the street you can hear her scream ‘You’re a disgrace’ / As she slams the door in his drunken face’,” “Castles Made of Sand” is hardly an uplifting song. The first verse chronicles the relationship of a couple who went from having a loving relationship to descending into chaos with arguments and alcoholism. The second verse tells the story of a Native American chief who is slaughtered in his sleep the night before a battle. The final verse contains a glimmer of hope, as Hendrix told the story of a little girl in a wheelchair who nearly rolls off the edge of a cliff until she sees a “golden winged ship” and changes her mind.</p><p id=par-5_38>While many have argued that this song is an instance of Hendrix reflecting on painful memories from his childhood, including his parents’ tumultuous separation and his mother’s illness, Hendrix himself never confirmed the inspiration behind the song.</p><p id=par-6_52>In a 2012 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a>, Hendrix’s <a href=#>brother Leon Hendrix</a> seemingly confirmed that “Castles Made of Sand” was about his family. In his case, the Native American soldier in the story was actually about him. “I was surprised to find myself the main character in the second verse,” he said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>Hendrix died a few years later at age 27</h2><p id=par-7_63>Hendrix and The Jimi Hendrix Experience continued to record new music following the release of Axis: Bold as Love. In 1968, the group released their third and final album, <a href=#>Electric Ladyland</a>. But the band soon parted ways, leaving Hendrix to form new bands in the subsequent years. In 1969, Hendrix gave a now-legendary performance at <a href=#>Woodstock</a> to close out the summer festival.</p><p id=par-8_20>At the same time, Hendrix’s battle with addiction continued to worsen. In September 1970, Hendrix died at age 27.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZqGipZlitaa6w6ugsatdmK60wMueqmalkZmybr%2FAp5tmmZKkwrV6x62kpWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
