(2008), and&nbsp;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014). He is also the title character of the Netflix series <a href=#>BoJack Horseman</a> as well as George Oscar “Gob” Bluth II on Arrested Development.</p><p id=par-2_62>Arnett has also been in the news for his personal life. Most notably, he was married to <a href=#>Amy Poehler</a> for many years. Upon their divorce, a number of fans sided with Poehler, especially since she was more well-known than Arnett. However, Arnett recently responded to these haters and urged people to resist judging a relationship that they did not know much about.</p><h2>Will Arnett and Amy Poehler were married for about 10 years</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Will-Arnett.jpg><p id=par-3_27>Arnett had a short marriage before he met Amy Poehler. He tied the knot with actress Penelope Ann Miller in 1994, though the couple divorced in 1995.</p><p id=par-4_29>Arnett and Poehler met in 1996 and began dating soon after. They got married in 2003. The couple has two children together: Archie (b. 2008) and Abel (b. 2010).</p><p id=par-5_23>However, their relationship came to an end in 2012. A source reportedly told <a href=#>Radar Online</a> that Arnett and Poehler simply lost their sparks.</p><p id=par-6_75>“Will and Amy started to feel more like best friends than a married couple,” the insider shared. “They drifted apart, like a lot of couples do, but there’s no malice in the split, nor was anyone else involved … Everyone used to think that because Amy and Will are both comedians their relationship was all fun. However, the laughter stopped a long time ago and now they just want to move on with their lives.”</p><h2>Will Arnett says that people ‘have no f*cking clue’ about his divorce</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-7_29>Despite news about the divorce being amicable, some people could not help but place the blame on Arnett, especially since Poehler was well-known and had a huge fan base.</p><p id=par-8_48>Earlier this year, Arnett had a conversation with <a href=#>Dax Shepard</a> on Shepard’s podcast, <a href=#>Armchair Expert</a>. The pair discussed what it means to have a shared identity when one is a part of a couple, and Arnett opened up about how he felt about people’s judgments on his divorce.</p><p id=par-9_59>“We both have the weight of a shared identity in a couple, which I have currently,” Shepard said. “It’s so dicey for me at times because … I’m pretty certain if something went sideways, which could happen at any moment, America is going to side with [my wife, Kristen Bell]. I think I’m probably out. She’s like America’s sweetheart.”</p><p id=par-10_82>Arnett chimed in: “I’ll say this, somebody actually tagged me on Twitter – a beat reporter for a Minnesota TV station – saying like, ‘I don’t know about you guys, but I’m Team Amy.’ And I wanted to respond and go, ‘We’re human beings in a relationship, and our relationship fell apart. It’s really sad. It’s heartbreaking. We have two kids, and this is not some f*cking game. What are you talking about? You have no f*cking clue what our experience is.'”</p><p id=par-11_24>Arnett shared that comments like this one did bother him a lot and that “it took me a long time to get over it.”</p><h2>Amy Poehler revealed that she and Will Arnett are on good terms</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_27>Even though Arnett and Poehler’s divorce was not sunshine and rainbows all the time, Poehler always maintained that she and Arnett never had bad blood between them.</p><p id=par-13_47>In 2014, she <a href=#>wrote</a> in her book,&nbsp;Yes, Please, that she was “proud” of Arnett for the way he has been “taking care of our children.” While some people might say that their relationship failed, Poehler also noted that she does not think “a ten-year marriage constitutes failure.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqrjLZpirppWpwW6yyKeYpaSpYr%2Bmv8%2BopZ2rXam8brTArZyrq12Wr7DB02aboq6fp7CmecWrpqZlkaLGbrzOnp%2BlnaJixrDBjKGYr51do7xussKkoKefXZi5trGNoaumpF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
