Apparently, Snooki herself wlll not hit the ring but, instead, has partnered with her father, Andrew, to host boxing events beginning on 1/28. I’m not even going to try and match reason with the bizarre decision to host ringside events where people beat the crap out of each other when Snooki herself has been on the receiving end of a punch or two during the course of “Jersey Shore.” Regardless, I’ve observed that Snooki and her father (he adopted her when she was 6 months old) have a very strange relationship. When she gets arrested at the “Shore” for public drunkenness, he always accepts the news calmly. And when Snooks flashes her hoo-ha in an Italian nightclub (resulting in her boyfriend Jionni La Valle fleeing the country), she calls her dad to warn him what he’ll see on television, and he seems perfectly okay with all of it. Weird.</p><p>Anyway, that’s not the real reason we’re here to talk Snooki today, so let’s move onto Radar Online’s insider scoop (from Star) that Snooki is allegedly pregnant with Jionni’s child. She certainly doesn’t look pregnant at this point, but it could be true:</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/FP_8566763_Snookie_Daddyslittlegirl_NYC_27_30.jpg alt title=FP_8566763_Snookie_Daddyslittlegirl_NYC_27_30 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Jersey Shore star Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi is about to drop her most scandalous bombshell ever, Star magazine has exclusively learned.</p><p>The pint-sized reality star and her boyfriend of a year, Jionni LaValle, are expecting their first child, reveals the upcoming issue of Star.</p><p>“She is pregnant and has only told her closest friends and some family,” an insider said.</p><p>Never one to keep her mouth shut, the 24-year-old can’t resist hinting publicly at her baby joy, explained the source: “She’s been telling people that she has a big announcement coming.”</p><p>Snooki will soon be starring in a Jersey Shore spin off with her MTV co-star Jenni “J-Woww” Farley and her new arrival will be part of the plot. “They are having to redo the creative direction of her spin-off because of her pregnancy.”</p><p>Despite her recent high profile slim down, the reality star has been dropping clues on social networking sites that she may be in the family way.</p><p>“I feel sick,” she admitted in a January 25 post on her Facebook page, then later tweeted: “Late night craving…yogurt hits the fricken spot!”</p><p>Now, the only question is — will she admit it?</p><p>[From <a href=#>Radar Online</a>]</p><p>Can you imagine the monstrosity that would be a pregnant Snooki? I mean, she already has pickle cravings (and famously guzzled from a huge jar of juice in the Season 5 premiere) on a daily basis, so who knows what she’ll want to eat. If Snooki is knocked up, she’ll have to <a href=#>put down the diet pills</a>, but at least we know she’s smart enough <a href=#>to save her money</a>, unlike several of her co-stars. Still, this would certainly transform into a gigantic mess of leopard-printed, Snooki-branded baby clothing and rhinestone-encrusted pacifiers. Would she fake-tan the baby, or would it just come out orange? Perish the thought.</p><p>Seriously though, I wouldn’t doubt that Snooki hasn’t exactly been trying to not get pregnant with Jionni. She’s crazy about him, has already talked about naming one of her <a href=#>future children “Jionni Jr.”</a>, and even dropped hints in the press about <a href=#>the engagement ring</a> that she wants. When Snooki recently appeared on The Ellen Show, she stated that Jionni is a <a href=#>“sobering influence“</a> and that she now only drinks a few glasses of wine weekly. Still, she admits that they can’t watch “Shore” together “because it just starts fights.” Translation? “I can’t let Jionni watch Season 5 because then he’ll know I’ve been trying to keep The Unit from spilling the details about how I gave a beej to The Situation.” Poor Jionni. He really has no idea, does he?</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Snooki is denying that she’s preggo.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wenn5741060.jpg alt title=wenn5741060 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/FP_7528096_SnookieJwoww_Boyfriends_CWNY_06_20.jpg alt title=FP_7528096_SnookieJwoww_Boyfriends_CWNY_06_20 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/FP_8566762_Snookie_Daddyslittlegirl_NYC_26_30.jpg alt title=FP_8566762_Snookie_Daddyslittlegirl_NYC_26_30 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Fame/Flynet and WENN</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma2hmZn5ye9KnpqijmZS6qrPHrZabnY%2Bgu7Cvyp6bmK2glK%2B6q8mipqemmZS5oqvVmqOlnY%2Bstq24vq2fnpeSlq%2B6q8GelqiqkaO0pns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
