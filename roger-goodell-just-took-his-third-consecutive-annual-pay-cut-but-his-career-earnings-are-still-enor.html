In 2014 alone, the league split over $7 billion in revenue with its 32 teams, giving each team over $200 million each.
So, then, why does the league's commissioner keep getting his paycheck hacked?
Goodell, who has been the league's commissioner since 2006, peaked in 2012, when he brought in $44.2 million. The following two years saw him pocket $35 million and $34 million, respectively."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

During his career, he's made $212.5 million. But when your paycheck gets cut by over 27% in four years, even though your organization is raking in billions, it seems like you deserve to know why.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-199803 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-508601918.jpg alt="(Mike Lawrie/Getty Images)" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-199803 class=wp-caption-text>(Mike Lawrie/Getty Images)</p><p>Goodell, however, isn't the only one seeing his bank account shrink. General counsel, Jeff Pash, is the second-highest-paid executive in the NFL, and he took a 13% cut, from $7.5 million to $6.5 million, this past season.</p><p>Though we're not really sure why all of this is happening, one thing we do know is that we may never have access to these types of records from the NFL again. This past year, the league has relinquished its tax-exempt status, and is therefore no longer required to release its tax filings to the public. So if you're curious about such things, you had better get your fill right now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqumoJ2iYrSwu8Oeo6VlmqrAtXnTqKakZZiewG7Ax6KpnWWTpLu0scKuq6KulWKur7rUmqNmqJGueqTB02g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
