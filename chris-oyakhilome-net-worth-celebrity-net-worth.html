Popularly known as the "Pastor Chris", Chris Oyakhilome is the founder and founding president of Believers' LoveWorld Incorporated aka "Christ Embassy", a Bible-based Christian ministry with headquarters in Lagos, Nigeria. The ministry has a handful of arms including the Healing School, Rhapsody of Realities and an N.G.O called the Innercity Missions along with some three Christian television channels: LoveWorld TV, LoveWorld SAT and LoveWorld Plus. One of the most influential preachers in Africa, Chris Oyakhilome has started to hone his orator skill ever since his secondary and tertiary school days.</p><p>Blessed with a natural charisma, he eventually managed to gather more than 2.5 million people in a single night's event through Oyakhilome's television programs that feature his faith healings, miracles and large meetings. However, he was involved in a $35 million money laundering case in which he was accused of transferring funds from his church to foreign banks. Having pleaded no wrongdoing, he eventually got free of charge and the case was dismissed. Furthermore, he was severely criticized by the Treatment Action Campaign for his support of faith healing as a way to cure HIV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wK6roaeiqHyktNGiqmanqZa4qbXLqKSeZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
