The team included Kyle Bingham, the operations manager of OceanGate, and a photographer and a videographer.</p><p>Those on the Polar Prince would have breakfast between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. each day before going to an all-hands meeting. Missions specialists were instructed to join, and Stockton Rush would go through a "long list of to-do items."</p><p>"She took part in the meetings and you got the sense that she was No. 2," Weissmann said.&nbsp;</p><p>The journalist added that Stockton Rush was the "driver of the operation" at OceanGate. But he also said that Wendy Rush was "in a support role. He ran the meetings, but Wendy would be the one who would most likely chirp in if there was something more to add, or if she felt his statement wasn't correct."</p><p>Weissmann said he saw a video from a previous expedition where Wendy Rush was "part of the team that was in communication with the sub" on a dive, helping track its location.&nbsp;</p><p>Aaron Newman, who visited the Titanic wreck on the Titan in August 2021, told Fox Business that Wendy Rush was always "<a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>looking over his shoulder</a>" to ensure operations were safe, although Weissmann says he "didn't get that feeling."&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Wendy Rush</a> is a descendant of two famous Titanic victims, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>The New York Times </a>reported last month. Stockton and Wendy both <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>attended Princeton University</a>, graduated in 1984, and got married two years later.</p><p>Before it was taken offline, Wendy Rush's <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>LinkedIn</a> profile said she was OceanGate's communications director and an expedition-team member.&nbsp;</p><p>An OceanGate representative told Insider the company was "unable to comment."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png alt="A picture of a switch and lightbulb" itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Sign up for notifications from Insider!
