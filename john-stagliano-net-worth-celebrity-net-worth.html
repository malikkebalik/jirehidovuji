In 1997, Stagliano was diagnosed with HIV and later faced a lawsuit in 2013 after allegedly neglecting to inform co-star Katie Summers of his condition.

He has received the XBIZ awards for Industry Pioneer (Web) in 2010, Man of the Year in 2011, and was nominated for Director of the Year for his feature release of Voracious in 2013. Stagliano's first marriage was to actress Krysti Lynn in 1993.
