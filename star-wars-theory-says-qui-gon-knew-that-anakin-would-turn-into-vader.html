After they save the Queen and her pilots, Qui-Gon’s journey takes him to Tatooine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">where he meets a young Anakin Skywalker</a>. Sensing his great power in the Force, the Jedi Master runs a blood test and confirms that the boy is even stronger than Master Yoda. It’s from there that he speculates Anakin may be the Chosen One, a person prophecized to bring balance to the Force. Alas, Qui-Gon’s journey comes to a close after Darth Maul defeats him in a lightsaber duel on Naboo. But the spirit of the Jedi Master continues to guide Yoda and Obi-Wan, not to mention Anakin himself.</p><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a new theory</a>, though, Qui-Gon knew that Anakin would turn to the dark side, but helped him get into the Jedi Order nonetheless. Maybe he knew that the only way to achieve true balance and defeat the Sith was to let the events take their natural course. After all, Qui-Gon was never one to stick by the rules and obey the Jedi Council’s demands. Besides, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there’s a high chance that Obi-Wan’s master was an agent of balance himself</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/qui-gon-jinn.jpg><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>While it seems absurd at first glance, it actually makes a lot of sense when you consider what lengths he went through, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">especially when they were on Tatooine</a>, to buy Anakin’s freedom and make sure that he becomes a Jedi Padawan.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=false>Of course, when you think about it, it all worked out in the end. Palpatine and Vader destroyed the Jedi Order, but Anakin ultimately fulfilled the prophecy and brought balance by killing his sinister master in the last movie of the&nbsp;<strong>Star Wars&nbsp;</strong>Original Trilogy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9KtmKtlp5a%2FtHnToZyoqqliwLazxp6qratdpsKqs86nZKSmlax6orrApKCnZaSqv6951Zqbnqpf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
