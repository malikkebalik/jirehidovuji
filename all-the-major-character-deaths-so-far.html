Like the original series, the show has seen much violence and death. But these are, by far, the biggest cases."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Read on to see the major <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Power Book II: Ghost deaths</a> so far.</p><p id=par-3_14><strong>[Warning: This article contains spoilers for the Power Book II: Ghost Season 2 finale.]</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Michael-Rainey-Jr-Tariq-Power-Ghost-Starz.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-danilo-ramirez>Danilo Ramirez</h2><p id=par-4_68>Fans will remember Danilo Ramirez (Shalim Ortiz) as the dirty New York City cop carrying on an affair with Monet Tejada (Mary J. Blige). He had a tense relationship with her son Cane Tejada (Woody McClain) and was eventually killed by him after failing to perform a hit on Tariq. Ramirez’s last appearance on the show was in the penultimate episode of Power Book II: Ghost Season 1.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jabari-reynolds>Jabari Reynolds</h2><p id=par-5_60>Jabari Reynolds (Justin McManus) was one of Tariq’s professors at Stansfield University, a job he secured with the help of fellow professor and former love interest Carrie Milgram (Melanie Liburd). There was something about the evasive Tariq that fascinated Jabari from the moment he joined his class, but that interest turned to obsession as he began spying on him.</p><p id=par-6_38>When Jabari found out about CourseCorrect, he tried to blackmail Tariq into letting him base his next book on his life. But he was killed for his meddling, in the finale of Power Book II: Ghost Season 1.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Caridad “Carrie” Milgram</h2><p id=par-7_37>Carrie Milgram tried hard to find Jabari’s killer. The more she poked around, the more it seemed her interference would be her downfall. But it turned out to be <a href=#>her relationship with Zeke Cross</a> (Daniel Bellomy).</p><p id=par-8_85>Eventually, her sexual history was exposed, causing Carrie to lose everything. In Power Book II: Ghost Season 2 Episode 8, Zeke went to visit Carrie after a huge fight with his family, in which it was revealed that he wasn’t Monet’s nephew but her son. Zeke was shocked to find Carrie dead of an apparent suicide. But really, Monet had killed her earlier that evening. She told her before her death, “If [Zeke] still has you to come to, he’ll never come back to me.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lauren Baldwin</h2><p id=par-9_51>Lauren Baldwin (Paige Hurd) was the good girl of the show, but her relationship with Tariq put her at risk of danger. That moment came in Power Book II: Ghost&nbsp;Season 2 Episode 9 when word got back to Cane that she had him and Brayden Weston (Gianni Paolo) on recordings.</p><p id=par-10_35>Brayden was supposed to kill her, only for Effie Morales (Alix Lapri) to show up and handle it. While Lauren’s death was not shown, the next episode suggested it was staged as a car crash.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Zeke Cross</h2><p id=par-11_77>Zeke’s hoop dreams were shattered following revelations about his age and family. He figured he’d move and start over, but he was shot and killed in the Power Book II: Ghost Season 2 finale in a case of mistaken identity. Zeke was boarding Mecca’s jet when Lorenzo Tejada (Berto Colon) ambushed him under the impression that he was Mecca (Daniel Sunjata). While he’s keeping what happened under wraps, it seems the truth will emerge in season 3.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dante “Mecca” Spears</h2><p id=par-12_72>As Lorenzo was making his move on Zeke, Monet was making her own on Mecca. After shooting and killing him, she got Tariq to help her with his body. He also wiped the video footage from Mecca’s apartment, but Blanca Rodriguez (Monique Curnen) was still able to identify him from the tapes in the lobby. The investigation is another focal point of Power Book II: Ghost Season 3, which is now filming.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9sMPEq2Sbp5%2Bgeqq1jKCfqKukYrqits6rZJygkaeupMDEq2SdnZGptbR5xZqpZ6Ckorlw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
