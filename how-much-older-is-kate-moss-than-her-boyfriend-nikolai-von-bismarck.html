She appeared virtually from her home in England and told the court that <a href=#>the actor</a> did not physically abuse her. She later spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC Radio 4</a> about why she wanted to participate in her <a href=#>former boyfriend</a>’s trial.</p><p id=par-4_70>“I believe in the truth, and I believe in fairness and justice. I know that John Galliano is not a bad person — he had an alcohol problem and people turn,” Moss said making a reference to the fashion designer who a French court found guilty of antisemitic abuse in 2011. “People aren’t themselves when they drink, and they say things that they would never say if they were sober.”</p><p id=par-5_23>She added: “I know the truth about Johnny. I know he never kicked me down the stairs. I had to say that truth.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The age difference between Moss and von Bismarck</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=par-6_45>Since splitting with her ex-husband guitarist Jamie Hince in 2015, Moss has been in a relationship with German aristocrat and photographer Count Nikolai von Bismarck.

He shot Princess Beatrice’s official 18th birthday portrait and was with her when she visited the Inca Trail during her gap year. Rumors swirled that they dated for a while but neither of them ever confirmed those reports. Moss and von Bismarck were guests at the wedding of <a href=#>Beatrice’s sister, Princess Eugenie</a>, in 2018.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The model says ‘being in love makes her feel beautiful’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=par-9_31>Moss, who has one daughter from a previous relationship, opened up about what makes her feel beautiful today and the wonderful memories she’s creating spending time with her boyfriend and daughter.</p><p id=par-10_52>“Being in love makes me feel beautiful,” the supermodel shared in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar, adding, “My daughter Lila inspires me to be the best person I can be.
