Her journey to fame started way back in 2013 when she had her first post on Instagram. It attracted a good number of fans and in no time number doubled itself up.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkylx27W6uM</p><p>The newfound fame reached another height when her uploads turned out to be bolder in bikinis and see-through dresses. Her popularity was increasing, and lots of modeling agencies were keeping the right eye on her.</p><p>Not only posting photos, but she was becoming close with the people from the entertainment world. The fame of this internet star went to peak when <strong>Drake</strong> gave a shoutout to her in one of his songs after this, everything for Miracle came as a dream.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Victorias Secret Model Miranda Kerr Age, Height, Wedding, Husband, Kids</a></h4><p>She started modeling and also launched her project like The Miracle Lash and also did photoshoots for big names.

If you readers have followed Miracle from her beginnings, then you might know the name <strong>August Alsina</strong>.

This incident took place in 2015 when they used to share images of each other on social media handles regularly. Suddenly the shaking stopped, and there were assumptions they broke up.</p><p>Immediately after the breakup, she was seen dating another man <strong>Tori</strong>. Tori is <strong>Jai Jai</strong>‘s baby daddy, and they had a pretty good connection. On 11 July 2016, a picture was uploaded which displayed kissing by both of them, and things started to get disturbed.</p><p>As of now, there is some noise in the city that Watts is single and is not dating or been in a relationship with. We believe that she is more into her career rather than any other thing.</p><p>One thing, however, is sure, Watts is not married or engaged up until this point in time. We feel a career is the main focus for her.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Watts is an internet sensation now who has done pretty well in the industry. After Drake shouted her name, she got unruptured fame that never seems to go.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elena Moussa Biography – Age, Height, Career, Model, Net Worth, Husband</a></h4><p>As of 2020, Watt has the net worth over <strong>$400,000</strong>. This is mainly due to her line of business and also social media fame. There is no detailed information about her salary, but we feel she is not much interested in showing off her wealth to general people.</p><p>Readers may be aware of the Miracle Lash, but this diva has another business venture too that adds up the net worth. The Miracle Tresses is the venture that deals with hair accessories.</p><p>All of this helps the diva to make a considerable amount of bucks. She also owns a Bentley that shows her assets accumulation. Currently, Facet Studio manages her works and career. We feel with time; more brands will increase her fame and net worth.</p><h2>Social Media Reach</h2><p>Instagram made Watts a pretty good name and also earned her fans and fortune.
