Daniel has earned much of his current fortune thanks to the James Bond film franchise.</p><p>When Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz revealed that they had married in a private ceremony, there were more than a few disappointed people out there.&nbsp; Daniel Craig had gone from relative obscurity to full-blown sex symbol in what seemed like record time, after starring in the James Bond film, "Casino Royale." His charismatic, sexy, dangerous take on the Bond, a darker and more "broken" version of the spy than seen in previous installments, was a hit with audiences, and catapulted the journeyman actor onto the A-list. After years of appearing in supporting roles in projects such as "The Power of One," "A Kid in King Arthur's Court," "The Hunger," "Elizabeth," "Some Voices," "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider," or award-winning leading roles in independent projects like, "Layer Cake" and "Enduring Love," he finally caught a break. As the success of his first two films as Bond rippled out into the cosmos, he was able to take on other big budget projects, including leading roles in "Infamous," "Defiance," "Cowboys & Aliens," and "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-264220 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Daniel-Craig.jpg alt width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-264220 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Daniel Wroughton Craig was born in Chester, England, on March 2, 1968. His mother, Carol Olivia (née Williams), was an art teacher, and his father, Timothy John Wroughton Craig, was in the Merchant Navy before becoming the landlord of two pubs in Cheshire. He has an older sister, Lea. Following his parents' divorce, Craig and his sister moved with their mother to Liverpool. There, he briefly attended Calday Grange Grammar School.</p><p>Craig was first introduced to serious acting by his mother, who took him to Liverpool's Everyman Theatre. However, he had been acting in school plays since he was six years old. When he was sixteen, he was accepted into the National Youth Theatre. Consequently, he left school and moved to London, where he financed his training by working part-time in restaurants. Eventually, he became a student at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and graduated in 1991.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Craig's first screen role was in the 1992 film "The Power of One", when he was twenty-four years old. He then joined the Royal National Theatre's production of <a href=# title="Tony Kushner Net Worth">Tony Kushner</a>'s "Angels in America" in 1993. Also in 1993, Craig made appearances in various television series, including the American show "Zorro" and "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles", and the British shows "Heartbeat", "Between the Lines", "Drop the Dead Donkey", and "Sharpe's Eagle".</p><p>What is widely considered to be Craig's breakthrough role came in 1996, when he starred in the BBC drama "Our Friends in the North", alongside <a href=# title="Christopher Eccleston Net Worth">Christopher Eccleston</a>, Gina McKee, and <a href=# title="Mark Strong Net Worth">Mark Strong</a>. Other notable projects he worked on during the late 1990s include: the BBC television film "Saint-Ex" (1996), the Franco-German drama "Obsession" (1997), the independent drama "Love and Rage" (1998), the biographical drama "Elizabeth" (1998), the television drama "Shockers: The Visitor" (1999), and the independent war film "The Trench" (1999).</p><p>Craig continued to stay busy in the new millennium, appearing in a large number of films covering a wide array of genres. Some of these include "Some Voices" (2000), in which he plays a schizophrenic man; the dark comedy "Hotel Splendide" (2000); "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" (2001), a poorly-reviewed by commercially successful film based on the popular video game series of the same name; the crime film "Road to Perdition" (2002) with <a href=# title="Tom Hanks Net Worth">Tom Hanks</a> and <a href=# title="Paul Newman Net Worth">Paul Newman</a>; a starring role opposite <a href=# title="Gwyneth Paltrow Net Worth">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> in "Sylvia" (2003); playing a cocaine supplier in the crime thriller "Layer Cake" (2004); and the BBC television film "Archangel" (2005). Additionally, he also starred in the original production of Caryl Churchill's play "A Number" from September to November 2002 at the Royal Court Theatre.</p><p>Craig was first approached by Eon Productions to portray James Bond in 2005. He was initially hesitant about taking the role, and producers had to work hard to woo him. When he did accept the role, there was a significant amount of backlash and controversy over his casting. For many, Craig did not fit the previous image of the Bond character that they had become used to. However, Craig also had many vocal supporters, which included many of the actors that had previously portrayed Bond: <a href=# title="Pierce Brosnan Net Worth">Pierce Brosnan</a>, <a href=# title="Timothy Dalton Net Worth">Timothy Dalton</a>, <a href=# title="Sean Connery Net Worth">Sean Connery</a>, and <a href=# title="Roger Moore Net Worth">Roger Moore</a>. The first Bond movie with Craig as the lead (and the 21st film in the Bond franchise), "Casino Royale", was released in November 2006. It was wildly successful, despite the initial casting controversy, and grossed a total of over $500 million worldwide. This made it the highest-grossing Bond film at the time. Craig's performance was widely praised by critics, and he would go on to star in four more Bond films: "Quantum of Solace" (2008), "Skyfall" (2012), "Spectre" (2015), and "No Time to Die" (2020). He has confirmed that "No Time to Die" is his last Bond film. After adjusting for inflation, Craig's first four Bond films, which were released by Sony, earned a combined gross of $3.5 billion globally.</p><h2 id=james-bond-salary><strong>James Bond Salary</strong></h2><p>Casino Royale: $3.2 million</p><p>Quantum of Solace: $7.2 million</p><p>Skyfall: $20 million base ($17 million base, $3 million bonuses)</p><p>Spectre: $30 million ($25 million base)</p><p>No Time To Die: $25 million (base)</p><p>Total = $85.4 million</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-300332 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Daniel-Craig-1.jpg alt width=900 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 2166px) 100vw, 2166px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-300332 class=wp-caption-text>Sean Gallup/Getty Images</p><p>Other projects Craig has starred in include the science fiction horror film "The Invasion" (2007) opposite <a href=# title="Nicole Kidman Net Worth">Nicole Kidman</a>; "The Golden Compass" (2007); "Flashbacks of a Fool" (2008) with <a href=# title="Emilia Fox Net Worth">Emilia Fox</a>; the war film "Defiance" (2008); "Cowboys and Aliens" (2011) alongside <a href=# title="Harrison Ford Net Worth">Harrison Ford</a> and <a href=# title="Olivia Wilde Net Worth">Olivia Wilde</a>; "Kings" (2017) opposite <a href=# title="Halle Berry Net Worth">Halle Berry</a>; and "Knives Out" (2019).
