Dr. Charles goes to visit Mrs. Farlo. He says that Choi had told him she was having trouble with her medication and he asked Dr. Charles to look in on her.&nbsp; She says this is all a big mistake.&nbsp; She had spilled some pills and didn’t take her medication, and that was why she was there.&nbsp; She talks to Dr. Charles about how he has an English name, and begins to talk about her late husband, Robert and when they came across to America in 1968.&nbsp; Their conversation is short and sweet, as she says people have forgotten what it was like before all this technology took over.</p><p>Dr. Charles meets with Choi and he informs him that she isn’t suicidal or confused, and she is mentally competent, but when he reads her blood work, he tells Dr. Choi she is eating cat-food.&nbsp; Charles says that she is an elderly woman with a refined taste and fixed income, and was probably too embarrassed to say anything.&nbsp; When Choi asks about her spilling the pills, Charles says her meds have street value.&nbsp; Choi is visibly shocked that a sweet, old lady would be selling her medications.</p><p>Halstead and crew finally arrive at the hospital with the car accident victim.&nbsp; Rhodes takes him and asks Halstead if the by-pass was his call.&nbsp; He says it was there only option and Rhodes tells him he will take it from there.</p><p>Robert brings his husband Lawrence to Sharon Goodwin’s office and introduces them.&nbsp; Lawrence asks her before they start if she is sure she doesn’t want to reconcile.&nbsp; She tells him they are beyond reconciliation; Lawrence then shows her the paperwork for the separation where both her and her spouse agree to live separately physically and financially from each other.&nbsp; She admits they have been doing that for months, Lawrence informs her that according to Illinois law a spouse without fault is allowed reasonable support and maintenance while the parties are living apart.&nbsp; She states she wants nothing from him, Lawrence gives her a pen to sign.</p><p>Drs. Charles and Reese meet with Phoebe’s mother to discuss how to inform Phoebe of her father’s death.&nbsp; She brushes them off and Reese reads into her behavior and tells Dr. Charles that she is lying to them.&nbsp; Charles tells her the reading on someone’s behavior is a bunch of bull, but she is right, Phoebe’s mother is definitely hiding something.</p><p>As Rhodes prepares to operate, Halstead asks him about the patient.&nbsp; Rhodes tells him that he hopes to remove the rib from the aorta and graft it, but when it comes to brain activity and paralysis, that will remain to be seen.&nbsp; Just before he steps into the OR, he says to Halstead, “You must be one hell of a poker player,” Halstead asks him why’s that?&nbsp; Rhodes tells him, “You took a hell of a gamble!&nbsp; Halstead is upset and Shore asks him if there is any word.&nbsp; Halstead shrugs his shoulders and Shore reassures him saying they had to try.</p><p>Choi meets with Mrs. Farlo, and asks her about how she is feeling, and then tells her that he is glad she is doing okay and he understands if she skips meals because some people have to do that to get by, like when money is an issue.&nbsp; She chuckles and he continues to tell her one patient was so stuck with no money they had to sell their medications to survive.&nbsp; She asks if he is trying to accuse her of something.&nbsp; He says no, and he is trying to understand her blood results.</p><p>As he is ready to leave, he tells her there are resources available for her, but she sticks to her story that she dropped her pills down the toilet.&nbsp; Her neighbor arrives and hands her her purse, and continues to talk to his patient about her “Princess” and that she is taking care of her.&nbsp; Choi tells them he will leave so they can chat.&nbsp; Choi tells Charles she won’t admit to selling her pills.&nbsp; Charles said it’s not surprising.</p><p>Reese and Charles talk about Phoebe and her mother.&nbsp; Manning joins them with the CT results and tells them the mother isn’t telling them her full medical history.&nbsp; They take her to a conference room and ask her if there is any medical history she needs to share with them, she said none that she can think of.</p><p>Dr. Charles tells her that the CT scans reveal that Phoebe has had several skull fractures, which can explain the hearing loss and are signs of child abuse.&nbsp; She at first is crying and then when she finds out they think it was her, she gets defensive.&nbsp; Dr. Charles tells her, unless she is going to tell the truth and shed some light on the situation, they will have to contact the authorities.</p><p>She tells them she lied and she is divorced and Phoebe would get hurt a lot when she was with her father.&nbsp; When pressed, she admits that she tried to confront her ex-husband, but he out-lawyered her because he had more money.&nbsp; Dr. Charles gets her to admit that her husband is still alive, and she had to kidnap her daughter to save her.&nbsp; She pleas with them to protect her daughter.&nbsp; They meet with Sharon Goodwin about the case, and she tells them it is not their duty, they need to call the authorities and let them sort it out.</p><p>April asks Halstead if there is any news and he says he is headed back up to check.&nbsp; Noah found his family, but they are four hours away.&nbsp; He says he hopes it is a happy reunion.&nbsp; Choi runs into Mrs. Farlo’s neighbor Ruth trying to use the vending machine, and he helps her.&nbsp; Choi says they have some nice things, but it doesn’t fit how she can afford to spend so much on a purse. After they talk Choi suggests that maybe his patient feels she needs to keep up appearances for others, and her neighbor admits that she can’t afford nice things either, her son is the one who buys them for her.</p><p>Manning informs Phoebe’s mother that they had alerted the authorities, but when they talk to Phoebe, Dr. Manning notices something is off with Phoebe’s hands. Dr. Manning runs some tests and tells Phoebe’s mother that she has a bone disease that can cause progressive hearing loss and it also explains the carpal tunnel in both her wrists.</p><p>Her mother asks if she is going to be deaf, and Manning tells her with a successful bone marrow transplant not necessarily.&nbsp; Manning goes on to tell her that this same bone disease makes her bones tense and easy to break.&nbsp; It also explains the skull fractures.&nbsp; She finally tells Phoebe’s mother that she doesn’t believe Phoebe was ever abused. Detective Alvin Olinsky (Elias Koteas) arrives in the ED, as Phoebe’s mother keeps asking, “what have I done?”</p><p>Halstead goes to see the patient he tried to save.&nbsp; Rhodes tells him it is too soon to tell if his brain function is back to normal.&nbsp; When Rhodes does a test on his feet, he realizes the man could be paralyzed, and Halstead is upset about what he had done to “this guy.”</p><p>Noah is with Halstead and the patient from the marathon, when Rhodes comes in.&nbsp; Halstead is angry, but Noah tells him they saved this man’s life.&nbsp; Halstead, “for what?&nbsp; For this guy to live on a ventilator for the rest of his life?”&nbsp; Rhodes tells him maybe not, and he is going to push him to see if he will wake up and what his mental status will be.&nbsp; He opens his eyes and is able to understand Rhodes words and able to perform anything he asks him to do, the only thing he cannot do is move his feet, but he can move his toes.</p><p>Halstead begins to cry.&nbsp; Shore chases him and tells him she is sorry.&nbsp; He tells her that the patient is alive and okay.&nbsp; She asks why he is crying and he says he was just so relieved.&nbsp; She hugs him.&nbsp; Rhodes runs into Clarke in the hallway and tells him he did a good job getting the by-pass machine out there.&nbsp; Clarke smiles.</p><p>Phoebe is crying as police escort her mother out of her room.&nbsp; Reese is devastated that Phoebe’s mother did everything and risked everything to save her daughter, and they are now sending her to jail.&nbsp; Manning says she understands why she did it, but why didn’t she have her daughter evaluated by a doctor before going on the run, and by not doing that she messed up so many lives.</p><p>Choi stands outside Mrs. Farlo’s room and is frustrated that this whole case was about “keeping up with the Joneses.”&nbsp; Dr. Charles tells him it was a good catch, and Choi said this was a new one for him.&nbsp; “Pride… Can literally kill you!”&nbsp; Dr. Charles says sometimes it’s the only thing we have left.</p><p>Noah grabs and hugs his sister and tells her that their patient is going to make it.&nbsp; April tells him she was proud of him; when he lets it get to his head she calls him a “dick”.&nbsp; Reese calls her mother after struggling with Phoebe’s case, and thanks her for the check.&nbsp; Joey comes to get Reese and he is confused because when they arrived she was mad at her mom and now Reese tells him, she wasn’t the best mom, but she did the best she could and now she realizes that.</p><p>Manning and Clarke are leaving the hospital and he feels like he didn’t do anything, but she reminds him that whatever he did, he saved a life; and THAT is something.&nbsp; Goodwin is mulling over her separation papers when Dr. Rhodes comes in to tell her that Halstead’s patient is doing well.&nbsp; She tells Dr. Rhodes to go home and put his feet up, he tells her he had something else in mind.&nbsp; He asks Goodwin if she wants to join him.</p><p>Halstead and Shore get back into their marathon clothing and head back to finish the run so she can officially check it off her bucket list.&nbsp; He runs ahead to hold up the ribbon and cheers her on as she finishes it.</p><p>Rhodes takes Goodwin to this place that Dr. Downey loved that place, and the owner greats her with a fresh lei.&nbsp; Rhodes makes her smile and asks her if she knows what ‘Aloha’ means and she thought it meant welcome.&nbsp; He says, “Not exactly, It means to consciously manifest life joyously in the present.”&nbsp; She says in that case, as she raises a drink to him, “Aloha!”</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaG9nk522pK3GqGSmnZRiv6avwKlkamhiZX53edKemKynnmJ%2FbrHPoqqonJVigm6x162pnqWVYrqmrdKuqZ6rXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
