Recommended Videos Aside from the names listed above, a fan-favorite islander who had an extremely short-lived experience on the inaugural season of Love Island Games was Kyra Green of Love Island: USA, arriving on day 5, instantaneously hitting it off with Megan Barton-Hanson of Love Island: UK, and then leaving on day 11 after falling short in a challenge."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In this cheeky new iteration, romance will meet reality as fan-favorite islanders are faced with both team and couples’ challenges, all while navigating dating, eliminations, recoupling, dramatic arrivals, and new competition twists and turns like never before.”</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>Naturally, being a strong competitor is imperative in this iteration of Love Island, and due to her poor performance in the iconic “Heart Rate Challenge” (which she competed in alongside Carrington Rodriguez of Love Island: USA after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Megan had to leave the hit competition show due to medical reasons</a>), Kyra and Carrington were ultimately dumped from the villa.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=780 data-injectable=true>While fans of the Love Island franchise got to see Kyra’s relationships with both Megan and Carrington play out on Love Island Games, the ousted islander revealed in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interview with PopCulture</a> that there was one connection that she had that did not make it onto our television screens, despite being a strong one.

They didn’t show it,” Kyra revealed, ultimately shocking fans of the Love Island franchise.</p><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=732 data-injectable=true>The 26-year-old continued, “That was the only time where I was like, ‘Okay, we’re friends, but we’ve always had this question on each other,’ and we were like, ‘Okay, maybe we’re going to pursue it in here,’ but things just didn’t work out like that in there,” likely due to the strong bond that Kyra formed with Megan from the very beginning, as well as the love triangle Cely was in with both Toby Aromolaran and Eyal Booker — it was just too complicated!</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>Given that the timing wasn’t right, have Kyra and Cely explored a relationship with one another since filming for Love Island Games wrapped? Naturally, the Los Angeles native cleared the air, admitting that those within the Love Island franchise are “one big family.”</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>“You never know what’s going to happen. There are so many different connections and things, but it’s an insane experience that only a certain amount of us know what it feels like,” she continued with a beaming smile.</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=106 data-injectable=false>Who knows what the future has in store for Kyra and Cely?
