Both witnesses refuted details from Maggie and Paul Murdaugh’s autopsies.</p><p>Eisenstat testified that he concluded that <strong>Paul Murdaugh was shot in the head from behind with the gun pressed against his head based on his examinations</strong>. Alex Murdaugh was seen sniffling and wiping his eyes during the testimony which included graphic photos of the victims’ bodies and autopsies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Maggie-Murdaugh-Autopsy-Photos-4.jpg><p><strong>Eisenstat stated that it appeared that Paul Murdaugh was shot from a high vantage point with the gun pointed downward</strong>. This could mean that the shooter was taller than Murdaugh, but Eisenstat did not state this as fact.</p><p>Palmbach testified that given the close proximity of the shooting, the shooter would have been covered in gunshot residue and bodily fluid. In his testimony, Alex Murdaugh contradicted his indictment which stated that he did not have any blood on him.</p><p><strong>In our previous posts, we covered more information related to Murdaugh’s case and you can read about them by clicking on the links given below:</strong></p><p>However, the prosecution has pointed to a Snapchat video that shows Alex Murdaugh in a different outfit than the one he was found in by police and the first outfit was never located.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Maggie-Murdaugh-Autopsy-Photos-2.jpg><p><a href=# rel=noopener>According to Palmbach’s testimony</a>, the facts point to a two-shooter scenario. According to him, if there was only one shooter, whoever shot Paul Murdaugh would have been too dazed or hurt by the explosion to turn around and shoot Maggie Murdaugh.</p><p><strong>Palmbach has stated his belief that Paul Murdaugh was shot first with the shotgun and Maggie Murdaugh with the rifle.</strong> So for a brief period of time, Palmbach said, “I think that particular shooter is out of this.”</p><p>To quote the movie, It’s not like they could instantly suffer that drop the shotgun run to wherever the blackout rifle is picked up and then in any kind of reasonable time period engage in any kind of meaningful assault.</p><p>As of right now, this is all we know about the case. We will let you know as soon as we hear anything new about this case.
