As the future King, Prince William isn't getting used to hearing, &#34;no.&#34; But one woman he was pursuing did just that.
Published on July 3, 2019   2 min read In the years before Prince William and Kate Middleton became on the most famous couples if history, Prince William had a bit of a reputation as a ladies’ man.
It’s true that he didn’t have as many public relationships as his brother, Prince Harry."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But as a young man in college, Prince William was known for his interest in beautiful women. And while attending St. Andrew’s he even got his first taste of rejection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Prince-William.jpg><p id=par-3_56>Prince William is remarkably down-to-Earth and humble considering his role as future king. However, he usually gets what he wants — that’s just a side effect of having lots of money and power. That’s what makes the rejection from his college crush so shocking. And the weirdest thing of all? Her name was Meghann. Talk about a potential royally confusing situation!</p><h2>Prince William and Kate Middleton met years before they started dating</h2><p id=par-4_43>Rumor has it that Kate Middleton selected St. Andrew’s over her <a href=#>top choice university</a> specifically because she wanted to meet Prince William. While that theory is unconfirmed, it’s true that Kate Middleton was introduced to Wills early in her schooling. It just wasn’t love at first sight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Will-and-Kate-1.jpg><p id=par-5_37>The pair were friendly for years before the pivotal moment when Kate Middleton walked in a charity fashion show wearing <a href=#>next to nothing</a>. From that moment on, Prince William was smitten. The pair began dating, got engaged, and got married.</p><p id=par-6_19>However, it all could have gone very differently if Prince William’s crush Meghann Gunderman had given him the time of day.</p><h2>Prince William got rejected by a Texan billionaire heiress</h2><p id=par-7_26>In her new book Kate: The Future Queen, <a href=#>royal biographer</a> Kate Nicholl explains that Prince William wanted to date a fellow classmate coincidentally named Meghann.</p><p id=par-8_33>Nicholl wrote, “When William asked her [Meghann Gunderman] out—something he did not do lightly—it came as somewhat of a shock when she declined his advances. This seemed to make him want her more.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-9_11>But even though he was persistent, Meghann Gunderman stood her ground.</p><p id=par-10_34>“I heard William ask her out on a date, but she wasn’t interested at all and she turned him down,” a <a href=#>friend said</a>. “He kept saying, ‘Why won’t you go out with me?’ She wasn’t having it.”</p><p id=par-11_17>Then he saw Kate Middleton in that infamous fashion show and it all worked out for the best.</p><h2>Who is Meghann Gunderman?</h2><p id=par-12_44>Her friends call her Gundy. The stunning brunette went on to marry NFL player Jason Sehorn in 2017 and created The Foundation for Tomorrow, which helps provide education for children in Tanzania. On social media, she appears to have a full and thriving life.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-13_56>Does she regret not giving Prince William a chance? It seems like her life turned out great without him, and she doesn’t have to worry about the pressures of royal life either. Given the chance to go back, there’s a good chance Gundy would do the same thing and reject Prince William all over again.</p><p id=par-14_19>It makes things easier for everyone that Prince William and Prince Harry aren’t both married to women named Meghan!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbXSZquesJGjeqmxyKucrKtdo66uscNmpJ6fmJa7r3nTrqmnnZRivbO1zZycZq%2BZobmqrcxmm6ivnmLEqbHNZp%2BeZZGouKawjKGcq2WfqsFvtNOmo2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
