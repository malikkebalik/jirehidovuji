Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what’s best for you, Mo Chuisle.”</p><p id=par-5_23>In a talking head interview, Pam identifies that Michael referenced the movie Million Dollar Baby, nervously adding, “He’s gonna try to kill me.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-there-are-numerous-office-and-devil-wears-prada-connections>There are numerous ‘Office’ and ‘Devil Wears Prada’ connections</h2><p id=par-6_44>During the Jan. 27 episode of the <a href=#>Office Ladies</a> podcast, hosts Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey discussed the episode and said they received many fan questions wondering if <a href=#>Krasinski and Blunt</a> were together when The Devil Wears Prada references were made on the show.</p><p id=par-7_8>“It was a coincidence, you guys,” Fischer confirmed.</p><p id=par-8_35>That prompted Fischer to dig in and see if there were other coincidences. “And it brings up a very interesting set of trivia that I have called ‘Six Degrees of Devil Wears Prada,’” she said.</p><p id=par-9_25>“The Office cast has a lot of connections to the cast of The Devil Wears Prada. Do you want to hear them?,” she asked Kinsey.</p><p id=par-10_31>“All right. Well, we know that John Krasinski will marry Emily Blunt,” she notes, adding, “Steve Carell will go on after this episode to star in Get Smart with Anne Hathaway.”</p><p id=par-11_21>Another star of The Office also had a professional connection, as Fischer explained, “Rainn Wilson was in Entourage with Adrian Grenier.”</p><p id=par-12_46>“Rich Sommer, who was also in Devil Wears Prada, will later appear on The Office as Pam’s art school friend,” she continued. “And listen to this one.
