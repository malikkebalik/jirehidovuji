The sports comedy was a massive hit, raking in $190 million at the box office, and it’s being speculated that the second outing will see him train a new waterboy to follow in Bobby Boucher’s footsteps.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=false>Richtman recently reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a sequel to Billy Madison was also in the works</a>, and while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin James admitted that he’d love to see a follow-up</a> to <strong>The Waterboy</strong>, Sandler’s recent efforts have mostly been based on entirely original content. It appears that the actor has had a change of heart, though, and we can now expect him to begin revisiting some of his classics in the near future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomJ2ZnWLAorrDpZyrZaKavbC%2B056bpbFdmbK3scuop6Kml2LEosDEq5mosV2osrLBxKVm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
