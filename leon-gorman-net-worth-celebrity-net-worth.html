During his lifetime, he was the richest person in Main. Born in Nashua, New Hampshire, Leon Gorman was the grandson of the founder of L.L. Bean. After graduating from Bowdoin College in Maine, Leon Gorman began working at Filene's in Boston. He then spent three years in the U.S. Naval Reserve, before returning to work for L.L. Bean. He served as L.L. Bean's Vice President and Treasurer initially, and then took over the company after his grandfather passed away. The business was failing, and he restructured the company and its product line.</p><p>His changes were very successful, and L.L. Bean has enjoyed almost continual growth since then. The store is now one of Maine's most popular tourist attractions, as well. In 2001, he stepped down as President and CEO of L.L. Bean, but was still Chairman of the Board until his death. He was also heavily involved in philanthropic work, with the majority of his donations going to public education initiatives. Leon Gorman died on September 3, 2015 at the age of 80. To honor his life, L.L. Bean's flagship store closed for the first time since 1967.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97wp6mrGecmryvecaoqaaZnmK7psCMsKarrJhk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
