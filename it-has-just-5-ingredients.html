What did I do wrong?,” the fan wondered.</p><p id=par-10_57>Garten chalked it up to the consistency of the whipped egg whites. “The coconut macaroons&nbsp;do tend to leak a little bit, but there&nbsp;shouldn’t be a ‘puddle’ beneath the cookies when they come out,” she explained. “Most likely, the egg whites were either under or over-whipped. For this recipe, it’s important to whip them&nbsp;just&nbsp;until they form medium-firm peaks.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_1><strong>Ingredients</strong></p><ul><li>14 ounces sweetened shredded coconut</li><li>14 ounces sweetened condensed milk</li><li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li><li>2 extra-large egg whites, at room temperature</li><li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li></ul><p id=par-12_7>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p id=par-13_39>In a bowl, combine the bag of shredded coconut, sweetened condensed milk, and vanilla.
