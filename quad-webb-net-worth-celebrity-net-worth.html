The show stars six women who are in some way involved in the medical industry. Several of the women are married to doctors while some are doctors themselves. Quad Webb-Lunceford is a medical sales representative and the wife of psychiatrist Dr. Gregory Lunceford, who is 13 years her senior. The couple own two dogs, Khloe and Kar'rie and supports several charities that help canines, including the Canine Companions for Independence foundation.
