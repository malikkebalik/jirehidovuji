And she’s clearly worked damn hard not just to get her career back, but to get her body back as well. According to reports, Brit was finally starting to feel good about herself when she started getting all sorts of mean-spirited nitpicky criticism about the way her body looks on her Circus tour. And understandably, it’s hit her hard.</p><p>Britney Spears is reportedly struggling to deal with criticism about her weight.<br>The singer is said to be ‘devastated’ by comments made during her ‘Circus’ world tour, dubbing her “Bulky Spears” and “jelly belly”, according to Heat.</p><p>“Britney has been upset by some of the negative feedback she’s been getting,” a source said. “She’s worked so hard on her figure and her fitness.</p><p>“She thought she was an unstoppable force, but now it’s dawning on her that she’s not as revered as she once was, which is causing her upset.</p><p>“She feels she’s put a heck of a lot of effort into the tour. It’s devastating for her to hear the criticisms. We just hope she doesn’t take it too much to heart.”</p><p>The star has allegedly started drinking specially-sourced shakes which include the African tree bark hoodia, thought to help with weight loss.</p><p>[From <a href=#>Digital Spy</a> via <a href=#>Gossip Rocks</a>]</p><p><a href=#>The Daily Mail</a> is the tabloid that gleefully dubbed Britney “Bulky Spears!” noting, “She went from cheeky police officer to ringmaster, cabaret queen to showgirl. Perhaps Britney Spears was exploring different sides of her personality at her comeback show. Then again, she may have just been trying to find the right costume to flatter what is a rather fuller figure these days.” Britney’s body looks amazing. It doesn’t look the way it did when she was 17. No one’s does. It still is top-notch. It’s almost unfortunate she ever looked as good as she did, because people are always going to be comparing her to her former self. I guess we all do that to ourselves as we age – but we do it privately.</p><p>The Daily Mail also clearly cherry picked some of the least attractive pictures they could find. We use the same photo agency, and there are much better shots available. Anyone can look like crap in the wrong light. I seriously hope Britney realizes what assholes they are, and chooses to be proud of what she’s accomplished.</p><p>Here’s Britney performing at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island on Monday night.
