It took a while, but Cousins is finally getting paid.
The Minnesota Vikings agreed to a three-year, $84 million with Cousins – with 100 percent of the money guaranteed. It'll make Cousins the highest-paid quarterback in the league."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Cousins will earn $28 million per year in his new deal. However, 25 years ago, the highest-paid player, <a href=# title="Steve Young Net Worth">Steve Young</a>, made $5.35 million.

He's ranked fourth in passing yards since 2015, amassing more than 4,000 in each of the past three years. In that same timeframe, Cousins is sixth in passer rating, and eighth in touchdown passes since 2015.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>A fourth-round pick in 2012, Cousins was used sparingly in his first three seasons in the league.

But after Griffin's career got derailed by injuries, Cousins gained steam as Washington's starter.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Even after a playoff appearance in 2015 and a Pro Bowl appearance and new franchise record in passing yards (4,917) in 2016, Cousins and the Redskins couldn't agree on a long-term deal.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When Washington traded for <a href=# title="Alex Smith Net Worth">Alex Smith</a> back in January, it was clear Cousins was not going to remain on the team much longer.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And now, Cousins joins a team in Minnesota that finished 13-3 last year and reached the NFC Championship game.
