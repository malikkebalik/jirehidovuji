Also known as the "Dark Destroyer", he held world titles in the middleweight and super-middleweight divisions. Nigel Gregory Benn was born on 22 January 1964 in Ilford, Greater London, England. There he finished the Loxford School of Science and Technology. Later he joined the army and served in the troubles for 18 months. Nigel Benn made his beginnings in boxing as an amateur and thus he held a record of 41 wins and one single defeat by Ron Douglas. In 1987 he turned professional and started a winning streak with knockouts. During that period he defeated Abdul Umaru for the Commonwealth middleweight title. In May 1989, at Finsbury Park, London, he successfully defended his title against Michael Watson. Next, he faced Doug Dewitt, from whom he took the WBO middleweight title.
