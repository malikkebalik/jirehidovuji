People have lobbed a barrage of hate onto the fighter for being a loud-mouthed egomaniac who endlessly brags about his ability and wealth. People have complained that Floyd avoided tough fights or, when he did fight, his strategy of dancing around the ring made for lame PPV events. Heck, even his former friend <a href=# title="50 Cent Net Worth">50 Cent</a> put Floyd on blast on social media for allegedly <a href=#>not being able to read or write</a>.</p><p>While some people might take the high road in this situation and say nothing, Floyd goes with a different strategy. Here's how Money Mayweather deals with his haters:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Post the following photo and message to instagram where you have 14 million followers:</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/floyd-1.jpg alt=floyd width=900 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Caption:</p><p>"Gotta love these backseat drivers so worried about another man's legacy instead of trying to write their own. Ultimately, I will always have the last laugh. This is just one of my many checks, a cool $100,000,000.00 that I still have every dime of. Y'all still have to work however, I'm happily retired. At the end of the day, it's them Benjamin Franklins that matter to me, so the jokes on you. I've made smart investments, sorry for those who thought that I couldn't read, write, or count. Y'all call them watches, I call them time pieces. Y'all call them boats, I call them yachts. Y'all call them houses, I call them mansions. Y'all charter jets and we own jets. #TMT"</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Drop microphone, laugh all the way to the bank.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-209431 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/flo.jpg alt="Ethan Miller/Getty Images" width=900 height=649 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-209431 class=wp-caption-text>Ethan Miller/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJonaWnqZl6rq3YsJyarJiav26%2Fx66rrGWYlsGmvtJmaGloXaK2rbjIqKVmoZ6owaKz0ZqkZqifqMFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
