The series also showcases the range of stunning properties these lavish agents make their bread and butter, of course, but its the drama behind the scenes that really sells Selling Sunset.</p><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=863 data-injectable=true>And, of course, the agents themselves. The cutthroat nature of the show relies <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on the many beefs</a> prompted by the brutal housing market in L.A., of course, but its ever-necessary drama is carried by the range of reality stars that drive its wacky story onward. A few of their names are sure to sound familiar — yes, Bre Tiesi is one of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nick Cannon’s many baby mamas</a> — and, after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">several seasons on the show</a>, Nicole Young is finally competing with the show’s most longstanding stars.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>She’ll never knock permanent fixtures like Chrishell Stause of their pedestals, of course, but Young is starting to collect a real fanbase of her own. After two full seasons on the series, she’s turning into a standout — so much so that fans even have questions about her husband.</p><h2 id=h-brandon-young-s-age-background-and-career data-injectable=false>Brandon Young’s age, background, and career</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nicole Young (@itsnicoleyoung)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>Nicole Young gained her new last name back in April of 2017 when she married Brandon Young, with whom she’s now shared more than five years of marriage. The pair seem to accent one another perfectly — and Nicole even credited her hubby with encouraging her to join the Selling Sunset cast. The pair doesn’t share any (human) children between them, but they do consider themselves parents to their two dogs.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>Brandon entered the Selling Sunset story in season 7, when he stepped into a longstanding beef between his wife and some fellow cast members. That got fans wondering about Nicole’s typically off-screen support system, and just what he brings to the table.</p><p data-characters=674 data-current-count=936 data-injectable=true>Brandon is exceptionally private, considering his wife’s high-profile gig, which leaves small details like his age up in the air. Some quick math, based around his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn account</a>, can give us a basic range, however. According to Brandon’s page, he is the senior director of music affairs at&nbsp;Activision Blizzard, which is a thoroughly impressive career. He started that gig a ways back — in 2003 — after graduating from Georgia State University in 1998. Assuming he followed the typical high school to college track, he was likely around 22 when he graduated. If that’s right, he’s likely around 47 years old in 2023. Nicole is around 33.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Brandon Young’s net worth</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nicole Young (@itsnicoleyoung)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=640 data-current-count=940 data-injectable=true>Brandon and Nicole have been married for more than five years now, and details on Nicole’s Instagram indicate the pair have been an item for nearly a decade. Brandon does have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an Insta of his own</a>, but it’s set to private, and doesn’t seem overly active. All that to say — the two’s lives are clearly intertwined. As such, its hard to determine just what Brandon is worth, monetarily, on his own. With a career at Blizzard — one of the biggest game studios in the United States — he’s certainly worth plenty of money all on his own, but Brandon’s private nature leaves his exact net worth up in the air.</p><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Estimations</a> place Nicole <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">at around $3 million</a> in net worth, however, which tells us that the couple are worth at least a few million as a family. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicole’s high-end position</a> — which she’s held since 2014 — certainly pays well, so that number is actually pretty modest. Once you add in Brandon’s annual earnings — which, while likely lower, are almost certainly still hefty — it seems probable that the couple is pushing $5 million, at least.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlnp6wsLjEZrCorZ6cwG601KyZmqaUYq%2Bzrc2dpqdllqe8rnnSnqOloZ6cerTBzaycrWWRnLJur8CrnJ6qXaOytXnWqKmtoF2XtrB5wKebZqWfp7Jw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
