One “winner” of The Bachelorette, Roberto Martinez, has essentially disappeared from the TV world since he and <a href=#>Ali Fedotowsky</a> called off their engagement. So, what is he up to these days?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-roberto-martinez-was-a-contestant-on-the-sixth-season-of-the-bachelorette>Roberto Martinez was a contestant on the sixth season of ‘The Bachelorette’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Bachelorette-Ali-Fedotowsky-Roberto-Martinez.jpg><p id=par-3_49>Roberto Martinez appeared on the sixth season of The Bachelorette, which took place in 2010. A minor league baseball player at the time, reports <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MLB.com</a>, he played Division II baseball for the University of Tampa. Then, the Rockies drafted him in 2001 and the Twins drafted him in 2002.</p><p id=par-4_41>Martinez was one of the final two men remaining on The Bachelorette. The other final contestant was Chris Lambton.&nbsp;Although Martinez never made it to the major leagues he did <a href=#>get engaged</a> to bachelorette Ali Fedotowsky at the end of the season.</p><p id=par-5_70>Fedotowsky says she chose him due to their strong connection and because he made her feel comfortable and secure. Martinez was always candid with his feelings on the show, and she appreciated that. He was also a total gentleman. What made them outstanding as a couple was that they had different qualities that made them a good match. Roberto was charming, and Fedotowsky was more down-to-earth. They both seemed family-oriented.</p><p id=par-6_73><a href=#>After his proposal</a>, Martinez moved to San Diego to live with Fedotowsky. The pair were together for over a year before ending their relationship in November 2011. The split was amicable, and the pair released a joint statement, saying: “We have come to realize that this is not the path either one of us wants to take in life and have mutually decided that this is what makes the most sense for us.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-roberto-martinez-s-life-since-the-bachelorette>Roberto Martinez’s life since ‘The Bachelorette’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-7_58>Since <a href=#>appearing on The Bachelorette</a>, Martinez has kept a relatively low profile. Currently, he lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and is working as a Farm Insurance Agent, according to <a href=#>US Weekly</a>. In December 2019, Martinez tweeted that he was engaged to Kristiana Elliot. However, it seems like the engagement ended as all associated posts have been deleted.</p><p id=par-8_55>Certainly, Martinez left behind the life of The Bachelorette and is living a peaceful life. He’s tweeted photos of his time outdoors in Aspen, Pueblo, and Rocky Mountain National Park — all in Colorado. Although he and Fedotowsky did not make it together, they rank among the best couples on the show, according to viewers.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_39>Concerning the former bachelerotte, Fedotowsky started dating radio personality Kevin Manno. The two got married in 2017. Manno and Fedotowsky have two children, Riley and Molly. It is clear Fedotowsky <a href=#>found love outside of The Bachelorette</a> and is happy.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZqmompWnwbB5zJqpraGemsdusM6ipaBlo567pLGMrZ%2BeZZKWsKmxy6ipnqykmnqpsYymmKuqmZqxb7TTpqNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
