Oh, she is adorable. As the announcement said, she was born at home, which is what Rumer had hoped for so I’m glad she was able to have that."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Lou-Lou, which is my nickname for her, no idea what the family is calling her, was born on April 18, 2023. And we got a full-face photo!</p><p>Oh, she is adorable. As the announcement said, she was born at home, which is what Rumer <a href=#>had hoped for</a> so I’m glad she was able to have that. I like the name Louetta, but then I love all kid names. I’m the easiest baby-name person. I just assume there’s a meaning behind it and give them all a thumbs-up. Anyway, Louetta sounds like someone who isn’t going to take any guff. Plus it’s in keeping with the off-beat nature of the Willis family, something Rumer said she’d consider in the naming of her baby. Isley might be a musical reference (Isley Brothers?) or maybe a family name. I love the maternal surname, let’s see more of that.</p><p>This is all the information we have for right now. I like that they took a week before announcing the birth to give them some family time. I love that they let us see little Loulie’s (I’m still workshopping) face. I know there are plenty of Willis women adoring this newest addition, she’s very lucky. I wonder if the Willis family is going to be the feminine version of <a href=#>that Michigan family</a> that only had boys for 138 years. Bruce Willis’ legacy will be this powerful line of Willis Women for over a century. He’d love it, I truly believe that.</p><p>If Rumer Willis is a mom, that means Demi Moore is a grandma. And that sentence just made most of Gen X look up from their coffee and go, “What?!” Anyway, congratulations to Rumer, Derek and everyone else. What a neat time for them all.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/coverimages52515741-815x1024.jpg alt width=500 sizes="(max-width: 815px) 100vw, 815px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/avalon-0761793423-731x1024.jpg alt width=500 sizes="(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photo credit: Instagram and Cover Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcWlka4Z1e9GupJ6qj6y2rbjIrJaappSUsaa%2BxKSWraCfoq60q9aeo5ynnZqspa3UoJ%2BtnaKUubDBxK2rmmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
