However, as Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) uncovers details about his mother’s background, she learns Tyler is a Hyde — the monster killing Nevermore students and people around Jericho.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wednesday-hyde.jpg><p id=par-5_81>What is a Hyde, you ask? According to&nbsp;Wednesday, <a href=#>a Hyde is a monster</a> “born of mutation” that “lays dormant until unleashed by a traumatic event or unlocked through the chemical inducement of hypnosis.” In Tyler’s case, Marilyn Thornhill (Christina Ricci) was the key to unlocking his Hyde. She was Tyler’s master and he did all of her biddings, <a href=#>collecting body parts so Thornhill could bring Joseph Crackstone back</a> from the dead to rid the world of outcasts like Tyler and Wednesday.&nbsp;</p><h2>How old is Tyler in Wednesday?</h2><p id=par-6_51>According to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Addams Family Wiki</a>, Tyler Galpin is between 16 and 19 years old in the <a href=#>Netflix series&nbsp;Wednesday</a>. In reality, Doohan is 28 years old. He was born on Jan. 19, 1994.

Doohan plays Adam Desiato (Hunter Doohan), the son of <a href=#>Judge Michael Desiato (Bryan Cranston)</a>, who accidentally hits Rocco Baxter (Benjamin Wadsworth) with his car in the first episode of the limited series.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_47>Coming from a mafioso family, Rocco’s parents want nothing more than to find out who killed their son and why. To protect himself and Adam, Michael weaves a web of lies that lead the Baxters to believe someone else is responsible — Kofi, played by Lamar Johnson.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_39>In the end, this lie is what gets Adam killed. Seeking revenge for Kofi, who is killed in prison by the eldest Baxter Carlo (Jimi Stanton), his brother Eugene (Benjamin Flores Jr.) aims incorrectly and shoots Adam, killing him.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_44>Your Honor&nbsp;will return with a second season on Jan. 15, 2023 — more than a month after the original release date, Dec. 11, 2022.
