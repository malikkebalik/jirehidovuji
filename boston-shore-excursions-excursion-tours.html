Walk the Old North Church, where Paul Revere ordered two lanterns hung in the steeple to signal that the British were approaching. Visit the Granary Burying Ground, where John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and Paul Revere are buried, and explore Boston’s North End, the city’s oldest surviving neighborhood and home of Paul Revere. Other Boston shore excursions that are steeped in history include stops at Beacon Hill, Trinity Church, and Old North Bridge, famous for “the shot heard round the world” that began the American Revolution.</p><p>For a fascinating look at American presidents, book a combination expert-guided and self-guided tour of the John F. Kennedy Library and of Peacefield, the home of both father and son presidents, John Adams and John Quincy Adams. At the museum you can explore the museum at your own pace. Then, enjoy a guided tour of the elegant plantation-home of the Adams family for four generations.</p><p>For a most complete tour of the city of Boston from land and sea, schedule a Duck Tour. You’ll board a revolutionary combination bus-boat vehicle that will first take you through the city, neighborhood by neighborhood, from Back Bay to Beacon Hill, the North End to West End, Financial District to the Seaport, as your guide points out significant historical and cultural facts about each area. Then, your amphibious vehicle will glide into the Charles River, and you’ll experience the city sights and skyline from the waterside, with your guide relating more fascinating facts and historical tales. There are also similar land-only tours available by trolley and by tour bus.</p><p>For those who delight in the dark arts and darker days of history, book a tour to Salem, the town famous for the Witch Trials of 1692. Visit the Salem Witch Museum, the Point Burying Ground, and explore the shops along the waterfront.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSusLPByKycrGaTpLpws8Fop6iqpKh8o7vSraanZ6OdvLOxjJ6vnK2iqLawutI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
