In fact, Hale’s initial tweet was a word-for-word repost of Eiding’s message. I am pointing this out not to accuse Hale of plagiarizing Eiding, but rather, that it shows solidarity with her co-star on the issue.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Please read.<br>If you do not have written permission to use my voice,<br>you DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION to use my voice,<br>including AI use.

In the game, Snake accepts a mission because he hears the voice of his former mentor, whom he thought he killed in a previous mission, on a cassette recording. But it turned out that The Boss really was dead and that the voice Snake heard on the tape was an AI replication of her voice to lure the soldier into a trap.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>In the broader context of Hollywood, a strike may be imminent with the Screen Actors Guild, of whom some members include video game performers, according to SAG-AFTRA’s <a href=#>website</a>. AI has been zeroed in on as one prominent aspect of the ongoing discussions, according to <a href=#>Deadline</a>, so it’s no wonder voice actors who work in such a field would like to raise awareness about the issue.</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=806 data-injectable=false>Like <a href=#>Eiding</a>, both <a href=#>Hale</a> and <a href=#>Hayter</a> have highly-rated Cameo accounts, in which you can pay the actors a nominal fee to have them record a video saying something that you can write for them (within reason). So we would recommend going through that route if you truly want to use their voice for something. That way, we can perhaps narrowly stave off the techno-nightmare of a future that Hideo Kojima envisioned in his games.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZopqBlnZrBoriMoJyaql2YrrTAjKyrmqaUqHqquoyspqWhlGKus7XTsmStp12XrrXAy55kmqFdq7yqr8Rmq6Gdlql8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
