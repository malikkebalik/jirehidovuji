Patricia Heaton earned the majority of her fortune and fame thanks her work playing the role of Debra Barone on the monumentally successful sitcom "Everybody Loves Raymond." She appeared in 209 of the show's 2010 episodes and ultimately became one of the highest-paid actors on TV at the time thanks to her $450,000 per-episode salary. That worked out to $9-10 million per season in the show's later seasons.</p><p>After the series ended in 2005, Patricia went on to star in a number of other projects. Over the course of her career, she has won three Emmy Awards. She has been called one of the funniest women on television. In 2012, Heaton received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><h2 id=everybody-loves-raymond-salary><strong>Everybody Loves Raymond Salary</strong></h2><p>Patricia Heaton enjoyed quite a lucrative salary as a cast member of "Everybody Loves Raymond," although her earnings fluctuated as the series progressed. During the first few seasons, Patricia earned $100,000 per episode â€“ which equated to roughly $2.2 million per season. During the middle seasons of "Everybody Loves Raymond," her salary more than doubled to approximately $250,000 per episode. This equates to $5.5-$6 million per season.</p><p>By the time the show entered its final two seasons, Patricia was earning $450,000 per episode. This left her with a hefty sum of $9 million at the end of each of these two seasons. In contrast, <a href=# title="Ray Romano Net Worth">Ray Romano</a> was earning $1.8 million per episode by the end of the series, which is one of the highest per-episode salaries ever earned by an actor.</p><h2 id=raymond-salary-protest><strong>Raymond Salary Protest</strong></h2><p>Ahead of the final two seasons of "Everybody Loves Raymond", Ray Romano's salary per episode was raised to a then record-setting $1.8 million per episode. At that point <a href=# title="Peter Boyle Net Worth">Peter Boyle</a> and <a href=# title="Doris Roberts Net Worth">Doris Roberts</a> were each earning $250,000 per episode and Patricia Heaton was making $450,000. <a href=# title="Brad Garrett Net Worth">Brad Garrett</a>, who was earning $160,000, was not pleased at the size of Romano's pay increase and launched a protest. At one point the show wrote Garrett out of a number of episodes and filmed an entire episode without him.</p><p>In solidarity, Patricia Heaton began calling in "sick," to support her co-stars. Boyle and Roberts soon also called in "sick." Production was halted for several weeks.</p><p>In the end, a settlement was reached with Garrett, Boyle and Roberts where they each got modest per-episode salary increases, but more importantly they received shares of the show's back-end equity points so they could continue making money every time it was sold into syndication forever.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-354291 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/patricia-heaton.jpg alt width=900 height=590 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-354291 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Rodin Eckenroth/FilmMagic)</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Patricia Helen Heaton was born on March 4th of 1958 in Bay Village, Ohio.
