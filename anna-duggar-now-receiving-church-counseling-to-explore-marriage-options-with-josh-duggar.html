Judge Timothy L. Brooks gave Josh a sentence of 151 months, or about 12.5 years. Once Josh is released, he’ll have an additional 20 years of supervised release. <a href=#>Anna will be 46 years old</a> by the time Josh leaves prison.</p><p id=par-3_66>Like the rest of the Duggar family, <a href=#>Josh and Anna don’t believe in divorce</a>. Divorce goes directly against the couple’s religious views. Josh and Anna went through tough times in the past, including a public cheating scandal that exposed Josh as having an account on the affair website Ashley Madison. But Anna made it clear that she didn’t want to give up on their marriage.</p><p id=par-4_68>“I know there are those who think I have every right to walk away from this marriage,” Anna said in a Counting On&nbsp;episode. “I respect other people’s views. But in my heart, when I got married, I vowed to God first, and to Joshua, for better or for worse, ’til death do we part … my prayer and my heart’s desire is for our marriage to be restored.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She’s reportedly receiving counseling from the church regarding her marriage</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_51>Anna Duggar doesn’t publically speak about where she and Josh Duggar stand now.
