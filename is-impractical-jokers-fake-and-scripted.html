Impractical Jokers, a funny hidden camera series that airs on TruTV, debuted with its first season in 2011 and is currently filming for its ninth season, which will air later in 2020.</p><p><strong>You may also consider:</strong></p><p>In this reality show, longtime friends Joe Gatto, James “Murr” Murray, Brian “Q” Quinn, and Sal Vulcano, better known as the comedy group The Tenderloins, compete against one another in a series of dares in which they try to fool an unsuspecting public on the streets of New York City while making a complete fool of themselves. The show follows <a href=# rel=noopener>Joe Gatto</a>, James “Murr” Murray, Brian “Q” Quinn.</p><p>It’s possible that Impractical Jokers falls into the category of reality television, but just because a program is labeled “reality” doesn’t imply that it can’t be written or produced to some level. All of these shows, including Amish Mafia, Alaskan Bush People, and 90 Day Fiancé, present themselves as reality television yet are heavily manufactured.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Is-Impractical-Jokers-Fake-And-Scripted-1.jpg><p>Due to the abundance of manufactured reality shows currently available, many people are beginning to wonder if Impractical Jokers is also fabricated. To put it another way, do the “unsuspecting marks” that are used in the pranksters’ dares have any idea that they are going to be duped before the dare takes place? Or, to make matters even worse, are they acting?</p><p>Fans of the show Impractical Jokers will be pleased to find that the pranks that are played out on the show are not rehearsed. During an Ask Me Anything session held in 2018, <a href=# rel=noopener>Brian ‘Q’ Quinn</a> made it very clear that his company does not use actors. In the same year, during an interview with the publication Life & Style, Joe Gatto shared his thoughts on the production process of the show as follows:</p><p>“It’s really authentic since the program works owing to that genuine uncertainty and nervousness, interacting with a stranger who doesn’t realize they’re on a hidden camera show,” said one participant. That is the secret to the success of the show.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>The game on impractical jokers where they call out fake names in a waiting room is forever hilarious.</p><p>— Kendra (@kendrakay1225) <a href=# rel=noopener>March 29, 2021</a></p><p>As a result of the increasing popularity of Impractical Jokers and the fact that the show has now aired more than 200 episodes, it is, of course, a little bit more difficult to pull out pranks now that more people are familiar with the cast members. It is helpful, of course, to shoot in New York City, which has a population that is far more than 8 million. Gatto went on to explain the following to the publication Life & Style:</p><p>“There are so many people in the city that if somebody knows us, we just have to move them along and select somebody else,” she said. If they recognize us, it means they are not going to be on our show.</p><p>In the year 2020, the universe of Impractical Jokers is going to experience a significant expansion. In addition to broadcasting its ninth season, the program has just been given the big screen treatment with its very own feature-length film, which will be suitably titled Impractical Jokers: The Movie and will be released in February of 2020.</p><p><strong>You may also consider:</strong></p><p>Impractical Jokers: The Movie will have some written parts in addition to cameo appearances from Paula Abdul and Joey Fatone, both of whom were formerly members of NSYNC. This is because the film format demands some sort of storyline. Fans of the show Impractical Jokers may, however, have peace of mind knowing that the prank moments depicted will be just as genuine and unscripted as they are on the show itself.</p><p>This was all about ” Is Impractical Jokers Fake “.
