By July 2022, <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>videos about the process</a> gained millions of views, and hashtags including "#permanentjewelry" and "#permanentbracelet" had hundreds of millions of views each.&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>Not one to miss out on viral fun, I took my mom to <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Catbird in New York City</a> to get our bracelets welded on. In the months that followed, it's become one of my favorite accessories — in large part because I never have to think about putting it on.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=premium>The process sounds scary, but believe me, it's not</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Though the welding produces a flash of light, it doesn't actually hurt. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Jordan Parker Erb/Insider</span></span></figure><p class=premium>Speaking frankly, having a bracelet welded onto your body sounds a bit horrifying. My mom was unsettled when I told her about it, but was reassured after learning that the bracelets don't attach to your skin and that the process is painless.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=premium>From start to finish, it takes just a few minutes: an employee fits the chain to your wrist, then welds it closed so there's no clasp. You'll see a little flash and hear a crackle, which is the welding tool "zapping" the chain together.&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>Even a year later, I still consider my permanent bracelet both a sweet memory and a fabulous accessory, and I'm itching to go back for more.</p><h2 class=premium>While my bracelet is still intact, my mom's broke</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Both my mom and I were thrilled with our matching bracelets. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Jordan Parker Erb/Insider</span></span></figure><p class=premium>Permanent jewelry is meant to be, as the name suggests, permanent. But nothing in life is guaranteed — forever bracelets included.&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>My mom's bracelet snapped while working out a few months after we got them welded on. Part of the bracelets' appeal is their tiny, delicate size, but it can also leave them vulnerable to breaking when snagged or put under stress.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=premium>Mending the bracelets is a simple enough fix; Catbird can reattach the jewelry if it breaks for a $10 welding fee. While my mom hasn't been back to the city since it broke, the option to have it rewelded gives me peace of mind while wearing mine — which has survived the year without issue.</p><h2 class=premium>I'm low-maintenance when it comes to jewelry, so I'm happy to have an accessory I don't have to think about</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>The bracelet is an easy go-to accessory, since it can't be removed. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Jordan Parker Erb/Insider</span></span></figure><p class=premium>When I take my jewelry off at the end of the day, there's typically a decent chance I won't put it back on again for days or weeks. Accessorizing is the last thing I think about while getting ready, so I've appreciated having a piece I never have to take off and put back on.</p><p class=premium>The bracelet I chose, <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel="nofollow sponsored noindex" data-am-orig-url="https://affiliate.insider.com/?h=787cb5b21f856325e997e47400157e679e0e80a56b549b16263e1015ddaa3a44&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.catbirdnyc.com%2F1976-bracelet-2019.html">a $144 paper-clip-patterned chain</a>, stacks well with my other jewelry and appears to be thoughtfully accessorized when, in reality, I rarely think about it at all.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufonyxsdGmmKednql6q7HWnqOrsV2Xv6KvxKWcrWWTlsGjtdGdZKedp2LGsL7KZp2arp%2BntrWxjJqanJ2jqLyzxYxrZ2trXW0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
