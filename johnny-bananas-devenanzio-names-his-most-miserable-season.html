Johnny ‘Bananas’ Devenanzio named his ‘most miserable’ season Seven-time champ Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio has competed on The Challenge consistently since his 2006 debut on The Duel.
Therefore, he’s faced several conditions that would make the seasons more challenging, including the Survivor-inspired season The Island, which he went on to win, and being forced to compete alongside his rivals and exes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, Johnny named season 32’s&nbsp;Final Reckoning&nbsp;(2018) as his “most miserable” season and pointed to the lack of human connection as the reason.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-4_39>Speaking to&nbsp;Ride or Dies&nbsp;rookie Olivia Kaiser during a February 2023 episode of his podcast,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Death, Taxes, and Bananas,</a>&nbsp;Johnny pointed out he and teammate Tony Raines were at the bottom of the house and “isolated” by the other competitors and production.</p><p id=par-5_50>He claimed everyone understood that if anyone befriended the two or attempted to work with them, they would also become a house target.&nbsp;The Real World&nbsp;star noted that human connection is essential and had difficulty lasting in the house for 10 weeks without it, especially as he’s from an affectionate family.</p><h2><strong>Johnny Bananas missed the finals in ‘Final Reckoning’</strong></h2><p id=par-6_20>For&nbsp;Final Reckoning, the cast competed in pairs alongside someone they had a vendetta against for the title and grand prize.</p><p id=par-7_47>Initially, rivals Devin Walker and Bananas were teamed up, but he withdrew from the competition due to his father’s death before briefly returning near the end as a Mercenary. Therefore, Tony entered the game as Johnny’s partner due to his memorable betrayal of his former mentor in&nbsp;Vendettas.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-8_41>They remained safe for the first several episodes and then saved themselves with two daily challenge wins. However, their rivals Natalie Negrotti and Paulie Calafiore finally came into power in episode 16, and Tony and Bananas found themselves voted into elimination.</p><p id=par-9_41>They called out Joss Mooney <a href=#>and Sylvia Elsrode,</a> who sent them to the Redemption House. Even though they earned their way back into the house, they were quickly sent home again, this time for good, barely missing out on the finals.</p><h2><strong>Johnny Bananas has won the most seasons of ‘The Challenge’</strong></h2><p id=par-10_49>After getting sent home first in his rookie debut, Bananas returned for&nbsp;The Inferno 3&nbsp;as part of Team Good Guys and made it to his first finals. Following a brief appearance in&nbsp;The Gauntlet 3, the California native competed in&nbsp;The Island, the first season to ditch the&nbsp;Real World&nbsp;versus&nbsp;Road Rules&nbsp;theme, and won.</p><p id=par-11_58>He returned for&nbsp;The Ruins, clocking another win before Tyler Duckworth eliminated him early in&nbsp;Cutthroat.&nbsp;However, Bananas followed it with his third victory when he teamed up with Tyler for&nbsp;Rivals. The reality TV star got his fourth win in his next season,&nbsp;Battle of the Exes 2, and then placed second in the subsequent&nbsp;Rivals 2&nbsp;before earning his fifth win in&nbsp;Free Agents.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-12_48>Despite impressive performances in&nbsp;Battle of the Exes 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bloodlines, Bananas failed to make the finals. However, he turned his luck around in&nbsp;Rivals 3, capturing his sixth win <a href=#>alongside Sarah Rice,</a> who had betrayed him. Therefore, Bananas didn’t flinch at the opportunity to walk away with the entire grand prize.</p><p id=par-13_30>It’s believed his decision cursed him, as the popular player went home fairly early in his next six seasons before finally securing a historic seventh win.&nbsp;The Challenge&nbsp;airs Wednesdays on MTV.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMnJ%2BapJyau6ixjKOmoaaernqjrc2apZqrXZmyt7HNmqWzoZ9iuqq%2FxKuYm6SVYsCmrdKopWegpKK5cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
