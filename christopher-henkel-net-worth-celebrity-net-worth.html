Christopher Henkel managed to get a spot among world's richest after he inherited a share in Henkel AG & Company, a manufacturer of chemical products like detergents and adhesives. The grandson of Henkel's founder Fritz Henkel, it was upon the death of his father Konrad in 1999 that Christopher received his portion in one of the world's largest makers of cleaning products and became a billionaire. Aside from the stake, he has also taken company's management and under his leadership, Henkel turned into an international powerhouse in chemicals and consumer products, with such name brands as Persil, Schwarzkopf and Fa. What was founded in 1876 went public in 1985 and now is run by some 80 family members from three clans who share an 80% interest in the $22.5 billion (2012 sales) business. Henkel AG, which is now comprised of more than 300 subsidiaries, is operating in around 70 countries around the globe.</p><p>Before he joined Henkel AG in 1989, Christoph executed various management positions at Nestle and Henkel operating units. Today, he is the Vice Chairman of Henkel's Shareholders' Committee, as well as the Principal and Founding Partner of the investment firm Canyon Equity LLC. The latter is headquartered in Larkspur, California and deals with global acquisitions and development of high-end boutique hotels and resorts. Precisely speaking, the affiliated Canyon Group of Companies' vast portfolio includes such properties as Le MÃ©lÃ©zin in the French Alps, Amangiri in Utah and Amangani in Jackson Hole, as well as the Jean-Michel Cousteau Resort in Fiji and the Four Seasons Resort Rancho Encantado in Santa Fe.
