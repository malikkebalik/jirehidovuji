Heck, there might even be a flip phone in the batch. What we're getting at is this: Selecting just the right smartphone is an extremely personal choice. The phone case you choose to put on it is perhaps even more personal because it is the first thing that anyone sees when you take your phone out of your pocket.</p><p>Beyond personalizing your phone, you'll want a case to give your expensive iPhone 8 some protection&nbsp; — especially now that it has a glass back. You may not need a rugged case, but nearly any kind of case will at least give your phone some protection from drops and scratches.</p><p>If you're planning to wirelessly charge the iPhone 8, you need a&nbsp;thinner style of case, because super thick ones won't work with wireless charging pads. Those of you who are just upgrading from an iPhone 7 to an iPhone 8 can reuse the case you currently have, but it's always fun to get something new to dress up your phone.</p><p>Luckily, if you own an iPhone 8, you have a large number of options for adding a case to your phone that provides the perfect style, while also giving you the level of protection you need. It can be totally overwhelming and hard to know which cases are worth the money. That's why we've rounded up some of our favorite cases for style and protection.</p><p>Whether you want a slim shell case that gives minimal protection and leaves all the ports and button accessible, a wallet-style case with card holders and a cover, a rugged case with tons of protection from drops, or something super stylish, we have a case for you.</p><p>Advertisement</p><h2>Here are the best iPhone 8 cases you can buy:&nbsp;</h2><p>Advertisement</p><p>Updated on 10/21/2019 by Monica Chin: Updated prices and formatting.
