Sometime in 2018, his popularity began to soar, and that bumped up fans’ interest in learning some of his great mysteries, including his height.</p><p id=par-4_29>You’ll note that the internet is full of blurbs and guesses on the exact measurement, but during a fun undercover Q&A segment with GQ, Elordi set the record straight.</p><p id=par-5_24>He hit each social media platform and found one comment on YouTube simply asking, “How tall is he?” Elordi revealed that he’s actually 6’5.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Elordi is the reason there are so many height miscalculations</h2><p id=par-6_40>Elordi didn’t just rattle off his height like a medical fact; he gave a backstory as to why there is so much misinformation about it. His height used to be a sore spot when it came to landing gigs.</p><p id=par-7_36>“I used to be so sensitive about my height because when I first started acting, literally everybody would tell me that I’d never work because they wouldn’t be able to partner me with people,” he said.</p><p id=par-8_40>He explained it would create an issue for potential shoots where directors wouldn’t want to raise the camera. Elordi added that he’d get nervous about telling people his real height, so he’d try to pretend he was 6’2 or 6’3.</p><p id=par-9_24>&nbsp;“So, online there’s all different kinds of numbers,” he joked. He said that telling people he’s 6’5 would make him seem like a giant.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Elordi also discourages fans from emulating his ‘Kissing Booth’ character</h2><p id=par-10_45>He’s aware that some fans are gushing about Noah or simply believe he’s the guy to admire. At one point during his stealthy GQ session, Elordi addressed a commenter whose girlfriend wished he was more like Noah and asked how he can be like him.</p><p id=par-11_39>He advised the person to be himself and was emphatic that he shouldn’t strive to be like Noah. Fans loved that. One YouTube user wrote, “The fact that he acknowledges that Noah’s toxic and shouldn’t be romanticized!!!!????? I STAN.”</p><p id=par-12_48>Another chimed in with “Jacob letting people know that noah flynn is a terrible person… we love to see it.” There’s chatter on social media about whether Noah is controlling or a dreamy boyfriend, with many viewers claiming the former. It seems like Elordia belongs to that camp.</p><figure class="rt-ig-embed wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-13_30>While The Kissing Booth 3 is on the horizon, fans will have to wait to see Elordi and 5’10 Zendaya hit the small screen together in Euphoria Season 2.</p><p id=par-14_31>He said because of the pandemic shutdowns, the series’ script and production is on hold. But you can catch him next in the film 2 Hearts, all 6’5 of him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMpKCsq5mjtG6uzqiroWWjqa6zecmamqiaXZq5sL7DomSesKChrqq60mauobFdnba0eceeoKCgpGK6orDEZp%2BipV2osq%2B%2FyK2gr51encGuuI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
