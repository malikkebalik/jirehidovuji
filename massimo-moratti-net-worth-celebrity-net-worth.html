Born in Bosco Chiesanuova, Italy, in 1945, Massimo Moratti was born into a well-to-do Italian family.

Moratti attended Libera Universita Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli. He became a well known figure in petroleum refining company Saras when his father died and left his shares to Moratti, and he eventually became the business' CEO.</p><p>Moratti also owns a company that works to produce electricity from oil's waste products. He assumed the presidency of Internazionale in 1995 and the club went on to enjoy incredible success, winning five Scudetti/Serie A, four Coppa Italia, a UEFA Champions League and a UEFA Cup. He was made an honorary chairman in late 2013 after International Sports Capital bought a 70-percent stake in the club and elected Erick Thohir as the new president. Moratti is married to his wife, environmentalist Emilia Bossi Moratti, and has five children. He serves as a United Nations Goodwill Ambassador for his charitable efforts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97zJqqrKGdpHquu9Gaq62hXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
