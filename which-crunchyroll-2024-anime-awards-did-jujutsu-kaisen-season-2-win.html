Recommended Videos Some anime enthusiasts were of the opinion that, prior to season 2 airing, Jujutsu Kaisen was a “mid-ish” shonen anime. Season 2 arrived to revolutionize the point of view of quite a few anime fans, including myself."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 he worked as director and on Storyboard for Ending 2 and 5 episodes, Episode Director for episodes 1, 18, and 23, Unit Director for Ending 2, and was in charge of Key Animation in 7 episodes (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AnimeNewsNetwork</a>)</li><li><strong>Best Character Design</strong>: It seems like the slight changes and adjustments in animation style and character design for season 2 were to the series’ benefit.</li><li>Last but certainly the most anticipated award, <strong>Anime of the Year 2024</strong>.
