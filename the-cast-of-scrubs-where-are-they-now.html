The show is narrated from the perspective of John (“J.D.”) Dorian,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">played by Zach Braff</a>. He begins working at the hospital as an intern alongside his best friend, Chris Turk (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Faison</a>), and a new love interest, Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke). The three face obstacles in the form of others within the hospital, like J.D.’s mentor, Dr. Cox (John C. McGinley), an unnamed janitor (Neil Flynn), chief of medicine Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins), and Carla (Judy Reyes), a nurse who catches Turk’s eye.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_45>Throughout the series, the doctors grow within their profession, as well as their personal lives. J.D. and Elliot have an on-again, off-again relationship that ends happily, while Turk and Carla marry and have two children. So eventually, they had to change things up a bit.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-scrubs-med-school-was-the-final-season><strong>‘Scrubs: Med School’ was the final season</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_60>New characters entered the mix in the last couple of seasons. Eliza Coupe, Kerry Bishe, Michael Mosley, and Dave Franco took on pivotal roles in the last season, titled&nbsp;Scrubs: Med School. The season took the action outside of the hospital and into the classroom, where Drs. Cox, Turk, and, to some extent, Dorian, began teaching a new generation of doctors.</p><p id=par-5_34>Sadly, the new concept wasn’t quite as well-received as the original. After the ninth season, ABC canceled the series. However, most of the actors went on to garner more notable roles, according to their&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>&nbsp;pages.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-are-they-doing-now>What are they doing now?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_54>Braff left&nbsp;Scrubs&nbsp;with hopes of furthering his film career. His 2004 directorial debut,&nbsp;Garden State, earned acclaim. However, Braff’s subsequent efforts didn’t do the same. His short-lived TV return,&nbsp;Alex, Inc., was canceled after just one season. In 2022, Braff appeared in two movies: A remake of the Disney comedy&nbsp;Cheaper by the Dozen&nbsp;and the HBO Max rom-com&nbsp;Moonshot.</p><p id=par-7_50>Faison has remained an active player on TV. He starred in the sitcom&nbsp;The Exes&nbsp;and the short-lived thriller series&nbsp;Emergence. Faison’s also taken on several recurring arcs in shows like&nbsp;Ray Donovan&nbsp;and&nbsp;The L Words: Generation Q.&nbsp;In 2020, Faison and Braff launched a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scrubs&nbsp;rewatch podcast</a>&nbsp;titled&nbsp;Fake Doctors, Real Friends, which has featured several former cast members.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_50>Chalke also has earned a lot of TV credits. She recurred in comedies like&nbsp;How I Met Your Mother,&nbsp;Speechless, and&nbsp;Friends from College. At present, she stars in the Netflix series&nbsp;Firefly Lane. Chalke also does a lot of voice work — she’s currently voicing characters for multiple animated series, including&nbsp;Rick and Morty.</p><p id=par-9_28>McGinley has made guest appearances in series including&nbsp;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&nbsp;and&nbsp;Chicago P.D.&nbsp;Over the last decade, he’s starred in two comedies:&nbsp;Stan Against Evil&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ground Floor,&nbsp;the latter of which was created by Lawrence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_17>Flynn went from&nbsp;Scrubs&nbsp;to&nbsp;The Middle, a popular ABC sitcom. After its 2018 cancelation, he starred in the short-lived&nbsp;Abby’s.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_30>Jenkins has continued to act in a limited capacity. He had a recurring role in Lawrence’s follow-up sitcom&nbsp;Cougar Town.&nbsp;He also appeared in two episodes of Netflix’s&nbsp;A Series of Unfortunate Events.</p><p id=par-12_51><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Since Scrubs, Reyes</a>&nbsp;has added some variety to her career. She starred in the mystery series&nbsp;Devious Maids&nbsp;and the beloved dramedy&nbsp;Claws.&nbsp;Reyes has also taken on several notable recurring roles in shows such as&nbsp;Jane the Virgin,&nbsp;One Day at a Time, and&nbsp;Succession. She appeared in the third and final season of&nbsp;Batwoman&nbsp;as the villainous Kiki Roulette.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMnJisrF2ks26%2Fwqusm6tdrLWmvsRmmKudXam1psWMp6awZpipuq17</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
