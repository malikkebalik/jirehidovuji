But sometimes problems arise, and YouTube TV doesn't work quite right. One issue is that you can't call the cable technician anymore — the problem is yours to solve on your own. With that in mind, here are seven relatively easy ways to troubleshoot and fix your YouTube TV problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Advertisement</p><h2 id=restart-the-youtube-tv-app class="toc-anchor premium">Restart the YouTube TV app</h2><p class=premium>If the problem is being caused by the YouTube TV app, an easy troubleshooting step that'll often fix the issue is simply to restart the app. That'll flush out the bad data that's causing the problem. Here is how to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-product-module=body_link>close an app on Android</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-product-module=body_link>close an app on iOS</a>. If you're trying to use YouTube TV on a smart TV or streaming player like a Roku, you can close and restart the app there as well, though the steps will vary depending on the device you own.&nbsp;</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Close YouTube TV and then open the app again. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Dave Johnson</span></span></figure><p class=premium>If you are trying to watch YouTube TV in a web browser on your computer, close the browser, open it again, and go back to the YouTube TV website. Another option: Switch to a different browser if you have more than one installed on your computer.&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>After closing the app, simply restart it and see if that fixed the issue.</p><p>Advertisement</p><h2 id=check-to-see-if-youtube-tv-is-down class="toc-anchor premium">Check to see if YouTube TV is down</h2><p class=premium>The YouTube TV service is reliable and working the vast majority of the time. Nothing is perfect, though, and every online service has occasional outages. It's easy to see if the problem is with YouTube TV, not with you. To find out with just a few clicks, go to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>YouTube TV's network status page at Downdetector</a> — or search for "is YouTube TV down" on your browser.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Check Downdetector to see if there is a service outage. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Dave Johnson</span></span></figure><p>Advertisement</p><h2 id=restart-your-device class="toc-anchor premium">Restart your device</h2><p class=premium>If you've gotten this far and it's still unclear what might be causing the problem with YouTube TV, it might be a good idea to restart the device you're trying to use. "Turn it off and then back on again" is time-tested troubleshooting advice. If you need a reminder, here's <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-product-module=body_link>how to restart an iPhone</a>. You can turn off many Android devices by pressing and holding the power button for several seconds or by pulling the control center down from the top of the screen and finding the power icon. If you have a smart TV or streaming media player, unplug it for two minutes and then plug it back in again.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=make-sure-the-app-is-up-to-date class="toc-anchor premium">Make sure the app is up to date</h2><p class=premium>Another potential source of your glitch: You aren't using the most current version of the YouTube TV app. Google updates the app regularly, and it's possible that your out-of-date app is causing a conflict with your device's operating system or some other app — or the app is old enough that it can't work properly with the YouTube TV service itself. As a general rule, it's a good idea to enable automatic updates, but if you need to update YouTube TV, here is how to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-product-module=body_link>turn on automatic updates on your iPhone</a> or <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-product-module=body_link>update apps on your Android phone</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertisement</p><h2 id=make-sure-youtube-tv-has-the-right-permissions class="toc-anchor premium">Make sure YouTube TV has the right permissions</h2><p class=premium>Apps often require certain permissions to work properly, and YouTube TV is no exception. In fact, you must enable your phone's location permission or else YouTube TV won't work properly.&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>On an iOS device, start the <strong>Settings </strong>app and then choose <strong>Privacy</strong>. Tap <strong>Location Services</strong> and make sure it's enabled by swiping the button to the right. Then in the app list below, tap <strong>YouTube TV</strong> and make sure <strong>While Using the App</strong> is selected.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Make sure YouTube TV has location permissions. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Dave Johnson</span></span></figure><p class=premium>On an Android device, start the <strong>Settings </strong>app and select <strong>Location</strong>. Make sure <strong>Use Location</strong> is enabled by swiping the button to the right. Tap <strong>App location permissions</strong> to find YouTube TV and then select <strong>Allow only while using the app</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertisement</p><h2 id=is-your-internet-fast-enough? class="toc-anchor premium">Is your internet fast enough?</h2><p class=premium>If you are having sporadic glitches or poor video performance, it's possible that your WiFi isn't fast enough. Thankfully, this is easy to check. On whatever device is giving you trouble with YouTube TV, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-product-module=body_link>test your internet speed</a>. It should be at least 7Mbps to reliably display video in HD, or 25Mbps for 4K video. If necessary, you can lower the video quality in YouTube TV to better match your internet speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=are-you-trying-to-connect-too-many-devices? class="toc-anchor premium">Are you trying to connect too many devices?</h2><p class=premium>Finally, remember that YouTube TV limits you to a maximum of three devices at one time. You can install the YouTube TV app on any number of devices, but you can only stream three at one time. If you can't start streaming, check to see if other family members or people with whom you've shared login information aren't streaming at the same time.</p><a id=post-author_profile-link href=# data-analytics-product-module=author-bio rel></a><a id=post-author_name-link class="post-author_link not-content-link" href=# data-analytics-product-module=author-bio rel><p>Dave Johnson</p></a><p>Freelance Writer</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufonyowcidnKxno6m%2Fpq3MoqWgZ6mkwrXBwZ5kra5do7y1edaoqaShnpw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
