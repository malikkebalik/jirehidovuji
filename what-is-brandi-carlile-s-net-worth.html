As a Grammy-winning artist whose songs have been featured in films like Safe Haven and The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants; TV shows like A Million Little Things, Walker, This is Us, and Grey’s Anatomy; and a host of commercials, trailers, and anywhere else songs play, Brandi Carlile is a multi-genre star."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But her net worth does not reflect that.</p><h2><strong>Brandi Carlile gained notoriety in the mid-’00s</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/brandi-carlile-net-worth.jpg><p id=par-3_54>Born in a rural town in Washington, Carlile’s early life was solitary.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">All Music</a>&nbsp;explains she had to “make her own entertainment,” teaching herself to sing. Raised with classic country like Patsy Cline, Carlile eventually found the music of Elton John. The intertwining of the genres of both legendary musicians laid the foundation for Carlile’s music.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_72>One of Carlile’s first gigs was when she was 14 years old. She&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sang backup vocals for a local Elvis impersonator</a>, which she claims taught her much about vocals. However, it wasn’t until she met her bandmates, the Hanseroth brothers, that her musical career began to truly take shape. Originally band members for the rock group, the Fighting Machinists,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Hanseroth twins, Phil and Tim, soon joined Carlile</a>. The trio is still inseparable today.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Brandi Carlile’s net worth isn’t very high</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_39>After Brandi Carlile’s debut came&nbsp;The Story&nbsp;in 2007. The album featured musical mastermind T Bone Burnett as producer. Carlile’s&nbsp;Give up the Ghost&nbsp;arrived in 2009. But it was 2015’s&nbsp;The Firewatcher’s Daughter&nbsp;that earned her her first Grammy Nomination for Best American Album.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_49>Known for her strong stance against&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gatekeeping in country music</a>, Carlile has collaborated with various stars across multiple genres. These include Adele, Dolly Parton, Sam Smith, Maren Morris, Loretta Lynn, Tanya Tucker, Amanda Shires, and Natalie Hanby. Going into the 2022 ceremony, Carlile has six Grammy wins out of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">13 nominations</a>.</p><p id=par-7_22>Despite all of this, Brandi Carlile’s net worth is shockingly low. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Meaww</a>, the award-winning artist’s net worth is only $2 million.</p><h2 id=h-brandi-carlile-s-lifestyle-and-philanthropy><strong>Brandi Carlile’s lifestyle and philanthropy&nbsp;</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_78>Despite her massive success, Brandi Carlile lives a low-profile life in rural Washington, roughly 10 miles from her childhood home. She lives in a log cabin she bought in her early twenties with her wife of nearly a decade and their two daughters. The property is shared with Phil and Tim Hanseroth, as is every paycheck she earns. From the beginning, the trio decided to split all earnings equally, leading to the bandmates becoming lifelong friends and neighbors.</p><p id=par-9_62>Carlile also has many causes that she supports, including her nonprofit,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Looking Out Foundation</a>. According to its website, the foundation “amplifies the impact of music by empowering those without a voice.” Proceeds from her 2017 album&nbsp;Cover Stories&nbsp;went to support War Child UK.&nbsp;Additionally, Carlile was recognized in 2021 with a Clio Music Impact Award for her work promoting gender equality in the music industry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvs63NnaBmm5Gnuaq4xGalnqxdrLyzwMdnn62lnGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
