While driving back to her hotel with friends, they passed singer Tom Jones’ home, and everyone began daring her to run across his lawn.</p><p id=par-3_75>“On the way, we passed by Tom Jones’s house,” she wrote in her book&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business</a>. “He was hotter than a firecracker at the time, and I said, ‘I wonder how Tom would feel if I just got stark naked and streaked right through his front yard?’ Well, I was just talking, but before long people started to say ‘dare’ and ‘double dare,’ words like that that make me lose control.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Dolly-Parton-14.jpg><p id=par-4_12>She told her friend to stop the car, stripped, and started running.</p><p id=par-5_51>“‘Jason, stop the car,’ I said, and before I knew what was happening, I felt the cool grass of Tom Jones’s yard on my bare feet,” she wrote. “Of course, that was a perfect complement to my bare ass parading around in the swankiest part of LA for all to see.”</p><h2>Dolly Parton said she usually likes to run through quieter areas than LA</h2><p id=par-6_24>While this behavior might seem surprising, Parton said she loves to run around naked. Usually, though, she does it in a more private area.</p><p id=par-7_42>“Sometimes I like to run naked in the moonlight and the wind, on the little trail behind our house, when the honeysuckle blooms,” she wrote. “It’s a feeling of freedom, so close to God and nature. Sometimes Judy [Ogle] runs with me.”</p><p id=par-8_13>She noted that she feels more connected to herself when she does this.</p><p id=par-9_33>“The full moon is my best time,” she said. “It’s a good feeling to have no makeup, no wig, no high heels, just my little stubby self. Just God’s little Dolly Parton again.”</p><h2>She said she tries to find laughter in every situation&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-10_41>While Parton likes to run naked, she said her streak across Jones’ lawn was mostly an attempt to <a href=#>make people laugh</a>. She admitted that she felt a flash of shame after running, but she was happy it made her friends laugh.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Dolly-Parton-15.jpg><p id=par-11_80>“Then, just as quickly, I got that feeling Adam and Eve must have had when they realized they were naked,” she wrote, adding, “I got back in the car, grass-stained, guilt-stained, and feeling wicked. I don’t know if Tom Jones saw me that night. I do know that shortly after that he put up a large wall around his property. If it weren’t for laughter, I would have died years ago, so I try to find it in every situation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxsLjLsmSpmaKpvK950ZqlZquklr%2Bsec2aop6cXajEorrKopysrF2lrrPAjKWYZp6ZobqqusZmcGasn2KCb7TTpqNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
