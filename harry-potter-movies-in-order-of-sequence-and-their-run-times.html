Furthermore, we’ve provided the run-time for each in case you’re in the mood to binge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-poster.jpg><h2>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</h2><p id=par-2_66>In order to understand any of the Harry Potter movies, you have to start with the first film, Hary Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. Also, called Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, the film follows orphaned Harry Potter who learns that he is a wizard. The most light-hearted film of the series, this film has a run time of 2 hours and 39 minutes.</p><h2>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</h2><p id=par-3_60>Harry’s back for year two at Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. But, he has to jump through several hoops in order to make it back to school. The longest of the Harry Potter movies, there’s a ton to unpack with this particular film, and it has a run time of 2 hours and 54 minutes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2 readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfdItImVNgA</p></figure><h2>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h2><p id=par-4_81>Next up on the list of Harry Potter movies is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. This film, directed by Alfonso Cuarón, is known as the turning point in the franchise. This film is distinctly darker in theme when compared to the first two. It’s also essential to watch in order for viewers to completely understand how everything unfolds from here on out. The third movie in the franchise has a run time of 2 hours and 22 minutes.</p><h2>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</h2><p id=par-5_61>Consistently thought of as one of the best Harry Potter movies, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a delight to watch. It introduces a lot of new magical elements and characters that the viewers haven’t been exposed to previously. It will take you 2 hours and 37 minutes in order to watch this movie from start to finish.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoneix</h2><p id=par-6_60>Though Harry Potter and the order of the Phoneix is the longest book in the series, it is actually one of the shortest films amongst the Harry Potter movies. With a run time of only 2 hours and 22 minutes, many fans were disappointed that so many details from this book, in particular, were left out of the movie.</p><h2>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</h2><p id=par-7_71>Number six of the Harry Potter movies is Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. This movie, like the one before it and the two after it, was directed by David Yates. Warner Bros felt it prudent to have the same director for the last four films in order to give final films a sense of continuity and similar thematic elements. The sixth film is 2 hours and 34 minutes in length.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><h2>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1</h2><p id=par-8_78>The Harry Potter movies are world-renown for a plethora of reasons. But, they also began the trend of splitting popular books into multiple parts in order to tell a more complete story. When Warner Bros opted to split up the final Harry Potter book into two movies, other popular franchises like Twilight quickly followed suit. The seventh film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1, has a run time of 2 hours and 27 minutes.</p><h2>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2</h2><p id=par-9_58>Last, but certainly not least, is the eighth and final Harry Potter movie. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 completes Harry Potter’s saga. Often heralded as the best of the Harry Potter movies, it is actually the shortest of all the films and has a run time of only 2 hours and 10 minutes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-5><p></p></figure><h2>How long would a marathon of the Harry Potter movies take?</h2><p id=par-10_83>That completes our list of all eight Harry Potter movies in order of chronological sequence. Though the films are all quite long, you can watch them all in the span of one day. If you were to watch every movie back to back with no pauses it would take you a whopping 19 hours and 39 minutes. But, that’s only if you don’t have access to a time turner. All films are currently available to buy or rent on YouTube and Amazon Prime.</p><p id=par-11_15>Need ideas for more magical movies? <a href=#>Check out this article</a> for more binge inspiration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1or7RsmSpp6SpsrN5zKitop2jYravec6rm56qXp3BrriO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
