Fans of the program may remember Nick fondly, but Valentine isn’t such a fan.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scott-Valentine.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-scott-valentine-s-backstory>Scott Valentine’s backstory</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-2_65>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>, Valentine grew up in Saratoga Springs, New York. He discovered a love of acting at only five years old, staging plays in his parents’ garage. After high school, he went to college for a few years, then transferred to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City, finishing their three-year program in only a year and a half.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_81>After school, he stayed in New York, and as a struggling actor, he worked as a short-order cook and a researcher for a publishing firm. In 1981, it seemed that he was close to his big break, landing a screen test for a role in a feature film. Unfortunately, that opportunity was lost when he was hit by a truck. After he spent three years recovering from his injuries, Valentine moved to Los Angeles. There, he landed his biggest role ever.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nick-on-family-ties>Nick on ‘Family Ties’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_67>When&nbsp;Family Ties hit the airwaves in 1982, the quirky sitcom became an instant hit. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Saratoga Living</a> reports that it went on to run for seven successful seasons, and it won three Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe.&nbsp; It featured the Keaton family, a mom, a dad, and four kids. The parents were portrayed as politically liberal former hippies, while their oldest son was a staunch <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reagan Republican</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_100>In the fourth season, a new character was introduced as the boyfriend of Mallory, the Keatons’ oldest daughter. Valentine played the part of Nick Moore, an off-beat young man who didn’t seem very bright, but had a big heart. Valentine was so popular as Nick that the temporary role was extended, and he appeared in 45 episodes.&nbsp;In 1989, after the show ended, the network tried to create a spinoff series starring Valentine as Nick, but the project never took off.&nbsp;Despite all the attention that Nick brought him, there’s still one thing about the role that doesn’t sit right with Valentine.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-he-felt-bad>Why he ‘felt bad’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-6_63>Although Valentine still acts occasionally, Family Ties is still his biggest success. However, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mental Floss</a>, it bothered him how dumb Nick was. Valentine had studied acting at important schools, and he felt that was a strange background “so I could grunt on primetime television.” Apparently, the work didn’t seem challenging enough for the rewards he got from participating in the series.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_77>“It was a lot of fun, but literally there were times where I only had to utter two guttural utterances in a show and they paid me a bundle of cash for it,” he explained. “I felt bad at times.” These days Valentine works as a hedge fund manager near his hometown of Saratoga Springs. Although a generation of fans remembers Nick fondly, he doesn’t seem to look back on the character with quite as much warmth.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSzornIpbBmrJmawG6%2FwqirrWWmlrmmutOipZ5llpq5tXnBmptmmZKkwrV50aijnmaYqbqtew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
