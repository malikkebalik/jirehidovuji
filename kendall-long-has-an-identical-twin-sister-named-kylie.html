Long and her sister were born in 1991, four years before Kendall Jenner and six before Kylie.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_48>However, names are not the only thing that ties them to the Jenner sisters. <a href=#>Long’s career</a> as a social media influencer and set dresser, saw her land the role of assembling the set used by the Kardashian-Jenner family during the Keeping Up with the Kardashians 10-year anniversary special.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-long-and-kylie-are-more-than-sisters>Long and Kylie are more than sisters</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_47>Long and her sister are pretty close if Long’s posts on social media are anything to go by. Although Kylie shuns the spotlight, as evidenced by her private status on Instagram, her sister Long shares their priceless photos of their time in Spain a while back.</p><p id=par-8_18>She also gives heartwarming tributes to her twin sister on their birthdays, signaling a beautiful friendship between them.</p><p id=par-9_39>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reality Steve</a>, Kylie did once appear as a princess character at Disneyland. She also appeared alongside Long in an episode of Fear Factor, where they participated in extreme stunts for a chance to walk away with $50,000.</p><p id=par-10_45>One of the contests they participated in was the “shock walk,” where they had to retrieve metallic flags from an electric cage suspended over water, all this while handcuffed to each other. Kylie also did appear for Long’s hometown date with Arie on Bachelor.</p><p id=par-11_40>However, apart from these appearances, Kylie prefers staying in the background, which explains why Long doesn’t tag her in their photos. Kylie’s Facebook page indicates that she works at Stoopid Buddy Studios, a production company specializing in Adult Swim shows.</p><p id=par-12_42>Both sisters attended the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Academy of Arts University</a>, and according to the school’s website, Kylie was a multi-sport athlete taking part in soccer, track, and cross country. In her college years, she expressed hopes of becoming a photojournalist for National Geographic.</p><p id=par-13_30>Kendall is the more public of the two and does not mind the spotlight. She has featured as a contestant on The Bachelor and its spinoff, Bachelor in Paradise.</p><p id=par-14_27>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bustle</a>, she has also been a set dresser for MTV’s Ridiculousness and Not Safe with Nikki Glaser.

Long survived until week nine when she was eliminated, consequently emerging as the third runner up.</p><p id=par-16_51>She was, however, one of the previous contestants to come back for the spinoff series Bachelor in Paradise as part of the cast for the fifth season. It is during this time that she fell in love with <a href=#>Joe Amabile</a>. They both quit the show midway but continued to date afterward.</p><p id=par-17_36>Amabile, a resident of Chicago, moved to Long’s hometown in Los Angeles amid plans to move in together. However, they split after it became apparent that Amabile preferred them to reside in Chicago, which <a href=#>Long opposed</a>.</p><p id=par-18_51>Long came back for the seventh season of Bachelor in Paradise, hoping to get over Amabile, who was also on the show and find love again. She, however, exited the show in week four, after it became overwhelmingly difficult for her to watch the blossoming connection between Amabile and <a href=#>Serena Pitt</a>.</p><p id=par-19_44>However, she returned in the season finale just as Amabile was preparing to propose to Pitt, and Amabile acknowledged that <a href=#>Long’s timing was unfortunate</a>. Her appearance served to show that his eyes were set on Pitt, and there was nothing to convince him otherwise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvoq%2FHnqOoql2eu268wKuYnaGjmnqssc2dmKWkXaG8r7OMopuepqSesKK4jK2uoqZdqLa0wMSrZKeZnZqxbrfYpaCeZpipuq17</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
